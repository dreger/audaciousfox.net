  <p>Bruce Schneier, cybersecurity expert and fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t the users: it&rsquo;s that we&rsquo;ve designed our computer systems&rsquo; security so badly that we demand the user do all of these counterintuitive things. Why can&rsquo;t users choose easy-to-remember passwords? Why can&rsquo;t they click on links in emails with wild abandon? Why can&rsquo;t they plug a USB stick into a computer without facing a myriad of viruses? Why are we trying to fix the user instead of solving the underlying security problem? [&hellip;]</p>

<p>We must stop trying to fix the user to achieve security. We&rsquo;ll never get there, and research toward those goals just obscures the real problems. Usable security does not mean &ldquo;getting people to do what we want.&rdquo; It means creating security that works, given (or despite) what people do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Digital security is already a paramount issue in our current world; yet, in practice, &ldquo;usable security&rdquo; is often neither. It&rsquo;s going to take a large amount of educating and designing before users can stay safe despite doing &ldquo;what people do&rdquo; online.</p>

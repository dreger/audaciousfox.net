Do you want to be a better scientist? Study architecture, cooking, economics, mechanics. Go outside your field and ask questions." That's some of the best advice I've ever been given. So often we get into viewing the same sites on the internet over and over again ad nauseam. Facebook, news, e-mail, rinse and repeat. The news is great for information but short on inspiration. Here are some of my favorite sites to get you thinking (about something else). 

1. Architecture - A great amalgamation of Art + Engineering + Science. Architecture and design is everywhere, not just in the buildings we see everyday. Have you ever thought about how useless a ceramic coffee mug would be without the simple addition of a handle? Thinking like an architect helps me to approach problems from a different angle. My favorite site for inspiration is [Architectural Digest](http://www.architecturaldigest.com/) which covers a range of topics that get me thinking. As a bonus I now know exactly how I'll design my imaginary house on Cap Cod.

2. Food - Cooking is just chemistry you can eat.(Footnote: ...without dying.) While there are plenty of places to go on the internet for recipes, the people over at [Epicurious](http://www.epicurious.com/) get the nod. Epicurious is a website about food as much as it is about cooking food. It tries its best to steer you towards ingredients we either don't use or aren't using correctly. Sure, it gets a little -buzzfeedy- with headlines like "17 must try recipes" (Footnote: I am acutely aware I'm criticizing list based articles while writing one. But this one only goes up to five! Surely you can forgive me for that, right? Right!? ...I'll work on it.) but I'm willing to overlook the listicle (Footnote: no, really that's what they're called. Now we all have a new Scrabble(tm) word.) format because it's all so well designed. Everything about the website works towards focusing you on the food from the slick design to the photography to the writing.    

3. Stats - We here at AF love our tables, charts and graphs. Like it or not we now live in a world of Big Data where companies like the weather channel can determine when people are most likely to [buy beer, or yogurt, or chocolate](http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/weather-can-predict-whether-you-want-beer-156404). With all this data flying around we need smart people to distill it all down. Nate Silvers' website [fivethirtyeight] (http://fivethirtyeight.com/) does just that. Their wheel house seems to be in sports and politics but there's a world of subjects to explore on their website. For instance, I once read an article about what people put on their sandwiches and I slept a little bit easier that night knowing that someone was working to answer that particular question and I didn't have to. 

4. Photography - Photography, like architecture, is another subject that's right on the boarder of Technology and Art. Sure you need to think about color and staging and light, but you also need to think about shutter speed, detector gain and focal lengths. One of my favorite websites for photography is Trey Ratcliff's blog [Stuck in Customs](http://www.stuckincustoms.com/). His style trends towards High Dynamic Range photography, which is an acquired taste for some. But his [portfolio](http://stuckincustoms.smugmug.com/)
is undeniably breath taking and his adventures around the world make for interesting reading. 

5.  Pretty Much Everything Else - If you're like me you don't ever want to stop learning, but picking up a book on Differential Equations can have a bit of a barrier to entry you're not willing to grapple with. The people over at [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org) have you covered with lectures on chemistry, art history, computer coding and beyond. The best part is that it's free and worldwide.

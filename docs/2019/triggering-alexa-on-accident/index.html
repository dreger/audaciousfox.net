<p>What can you do to stop Alexa from recording? Amazon’s answer is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/12/no-mark-zuckerberg-were-not-really-in-control-of-our-data/">straight out of the Facebook playbook</a>: “Customers have control,” it says — but the product’s design clearly isn’t meeting our needs. You can manually delete past recordings if you know exactly <a href="http://amazon.com/alexaprivacy">where to look</a> and remember to keep going back. You cannot stop Amazon from making these recordings, aside from muting the Echo’s microphone (defeating its main purpose) or unplugging the darned thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been using an Echo Dot for the past two weeks, and in reviewing my own past recordings I found one snippet that was just of my son crying. (Crying I assume over what we had given him for lunch.) Based on how many times we&rsquo;ve initiated Alexa so far, our unintentional activation rate is around 2.5%. That&rsquo;s&hellip; bad? I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Part of this is the compromise of even bringing these devices into our homes—we trade manually setting kitchen timers and looking up measurement conversions for the convenience of an always-present assistant that also happens to be a recording device connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>Still, I&rsquo;d feel better if Amazon had <em>less</em> information about me and I was <em>more</em> aware of when Alexa was listening. Thankfully both of these things are possible. The first is accomplished by deleting <a href="http://amazon.com/alexaprivacy">your own Alexa recordings</a>, and the second can be done by enabling the Echo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Start of Request&rdquo; sound, found under the Settings. I&rsquo;m still not sold on the Echo Dot as a permanent fixture of our counter space, and unintentional activations are definitely something I&rsquo;ll be keeping an eye on for the next few weeks.</p>

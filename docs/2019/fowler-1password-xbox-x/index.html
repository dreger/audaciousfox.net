<p>What a week. If you haven&rsquo;t been keeping up Liverpool lately, they&rsquo;re killing it. I haven&rsquo;t seen them lose yet and that&rsquo;s something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WT:Social’s interface is rather sparse at the moment, featuring a simple feed comprised of news stories and comments below them. News is a big part of the network; it’s a spinoff of Wales’ previous project, WikiTribune, which sought to be a global news site comprised of professional journalists and citizen contributors. Both WikiTribune and WT:Social emphasize combatting fake news, highlighting evidence-based coverage over the focus on ‘engagement’ seen on other networks. Each story posted to the network makes prominent where the article comes from, as well as sources and references.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Facebook can change their image to benign faster thatn WT:Social can gain any sort of market share.</p>

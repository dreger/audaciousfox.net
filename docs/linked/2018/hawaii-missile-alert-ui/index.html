    <p>I&rsquo;m not going to mock an interface that was obviously done by someone who might have a few other important things on their plate, but this is an incredibly misleading design. Thank God you can only send mobile alerts from here and not, you know, actual missiles.</p>

<p>A practical, real example for why you should start your interface designs by <a href="https://audaciousfox.net/2018/start-with-words/">focusing on the words</a>.</p>

<p>Aside: Although the correction took too long to get out, I thought the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/13/us/hawaii-missile.html">message on Hawaii&rsquo;s digital highway signs</a>, &ldquo;missile alert / in error / there is no threat&rdquo; was particularly terse and efficient.</p>

<p><strong>Correction:</strong> The State of Hawaii is saying the original screenshot shared with the media was only meant as an example. The actual screen can&rsquo;t be shared due to security concerns, but the state emergency agency has since provided a &ldquo;more accurate&rdquo; example, which you can see in <a href="http://www.civilbeat.org/2018/01/hawaii-distributed-phony-image-of-missile-warning-screen/">Marcel Honore&rsquo;s piece</a> for the <em>Honolulu Civil Beat</em>. Looking at both images, and assuming they&rsquo;re close to the original interface, I think my comment of &ldquo;incredibly misleading&rdquo; still stands.</p>

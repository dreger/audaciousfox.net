    <p>Megan Farokhmanesh, <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Telltale Games, creators of episodic adventure games like <em>The Walking Dead</em>, <em>The Wolf Among Us</em>, and <em>Batman: The Enemy Within</em>, laid off a large number of its staff today. The company will retain a small team of 25. According to multiple sources <em>The Verge</em> spoke with, employees were let go with no severance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today Telltale Games made the difficult decision to begin a majority studio closure following a year marked by insurmountable challenges,&ldquo; <a href="https://twitter.com/telltalegames/status/1043252010999410689">the company said in a statement</a>. &ldquo;A majority of the company&rsquo;s employees were dismissed earlier this morning.&rdquo; The remaining employees will stay on &ldquo;to fulfill the company&rsquo;s obligations to its board and partners,&rdquo; according to Telltale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Co-founder and former CEO Kevin Bruner (he left Telltale over a year ago), <a href="https://www.brunerhouse.com/blog/2018/9/21/telltale-closure">on his personal site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, I’m mostly saddened for the people who are losing their jobs at a studio they love. And I’m also saddened at the loss of a studio that green-lit crazy ideas that no one else would consider. I’m comforted a bit knowing there are now so many new talented people and studios creating games in the evolving narrative genre. While I look forward to those games and new developments, and continuing to contribute, I will always find “A Telltale Game” to have been a unique offering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This news comes several months after Ms. Farokhmanesh first reported <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17130056/telltale-games-developer-layoffs-toxic-video-game-industry">on the turmoil inside of Telltale Games</a> following their meteoric rise. Yet, a few months after Ms. Farokhmanesh&rsquo;s reporting, the studio announced it had (among other developments) <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/6/13/17460834/netflix-telltale-minecraft-story-mode-stranger-things-game">partnered with Netflix</a> to create a game adaptation of <em>Stranger Things</em>, which led me to believe things were getting a little bit better.</p>

<p>I really <a href="https://audaciousfox.net/linked/2018/toxic-telltale/">wanted them to pull through</a>. Telltale had some of the best art- and narrative-driven games I&rsquo;ve ever played. There was a lot of talent inside that studio, and I hope they all end up alright.</p>

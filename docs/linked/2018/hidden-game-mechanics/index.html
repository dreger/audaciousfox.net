  <div class="article__content">
    <p>As game designer Jennifer Scheurle was prepared to speak at the 2018 Game Develoeprs Conference, she asked her Twitter followers for examples of &ldquo;brilliant mechanics in games that are hidden from the player to get across a certain feeling.&rdquo; There were hundreds of replies, many from the game developers themselves, and the insight was fascinating. The <a href="https://twitter.com/gaohmee/status/903510060197744640">original thread</a> is a lot of fun to read through, but here are some of my favorites:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/charliexbutler/status/903937320038096896">Charlie Butler</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure if it was mentioned, but the tutorial in Halo 2 asked player to look up. Their input determined whether y-axis would be inverted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/findmattcox/status/904817572490686464">Matt Cox</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Scribblenauts, we used synonyms liberally to spawn the same object, but that object kept the name you spelled, making it seem unique!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Gaohmee/status/903510296534204416">Ms. Scheurle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed and Doom value the last bit of health as more hit points than the rest of it to encourage a feeling of <em>JUST</em> surviving.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TheElfquist/status/903694421434277888">Paul Hellquist</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Bioshock if you would have taken your last pt of dmg you instead were invuln for abt 1-2 sec so you get more &ldquo;barely survived&rdquo; moments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/levine/status/903803566825119745">Ken Levine</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First shots from an enemy against you in BioShock always missed&hellip;that was the design, think it got fully implemented. No &ldquo;out of blue!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/polymonkey/status/903830218455924736">Matt Ditton</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Jak and Dexter the player would &ldquo;for no reason&rdquo; trip and fall to give enough time to load the next section off disc. [&hellip;] In the era of open world and &ldquo;no load screens&rdquo; you needed to stop the player going too fast. Disc load time was a nightmare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/tom_forsyth/status/903631390389936128">Tom Forsyth</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>HL1 [Half-Life 1] - if facing more than two enemies, only two would actually attack. The rest would run to random locations and bark lies e.g. &ldquo;flanking&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/GamesWriting/status/903526469367992321">James Parker</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most (good) platform games allow you a small window after you run off the edge of a platform to initiate a jump</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If only Wile E. Coyote had such luck.</p>

<p>Some of these might leave you feeling like Dorothy when Oz is revealed, but I love seeing how and when a developer might deploy a cheat on the player&rsquo;s behalf. And, although I enjoyed reading through the various game mechanics, some of the best replies were from players who never realized what was happening.</p>

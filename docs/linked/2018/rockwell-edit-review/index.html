    <p>Michael Rockwell, <em>Initial Charge</em>, in his review of Edit:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Overall, this is the sentiment I&rsquo;ve been seeing. It&rsquo;s humbling how much Edit is resonating with people. A few weeks ago, it was just my little app.</p>

<p>Mr. Rockwell has a few points of criticism that — as the sole developer and designer — I really enjoyed reading. One of his main call-outs is the lack of iCloud syncing, or the inability to start a note on your iPhone and finish writing on your iPad.</p>

<p>I get the draw, really. I don&rsquo;t have an iPad, so this particular pain was probably lost on me as I fiddled with the Xcode simulators, but enough people have asked about it that I am actively working on figuring out a solution. Ideally, I can use your iCloud accounts to sync the current sheet back and forth, but I have speed concerns that I haven&rsquo;t been able to test yet. I’ve long thought that a syncing service should be fast enough that all changes are committed and sent to the server by the time a user can close the app or shut their laptop lid/smart cover. If CloudKit isn&rsquo;t able to provide that sort of performance, I might need to look at a few other options. Whatever I end up doing though, it’ll be totally seamless for the users; you’ll turn it on, and it&rsquo;ll just work.</p>

    <p>Executive Editor and co-founder at <em>Polygon</em>, Chris Plante:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Games have changed since we launched Polygon. We&rsquo;re changing with them. </p>

<p>We believe that a new strategy, focusing on <em>criticism</em> and <em>curation</em>, will better serve our readers than the serviceable but ultimately limited reviews rubric that, for decades, has functioned as a load-bearing pillar of most game publications.</p>

<p>As part of this evolution, Polygon will no longer score reviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Polygon&rsquo;s</em> updated review strategy is built around two new programs: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/recommends">Recommends</a> (labeling to endorse a particular title) and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/essentials">Essentials</a> (curated lists of the best games available). As Mr. Plante <a href="https://twitter.com/plante/status/1037049092998881280">points out</a>, <em>Polygon</em> is following the lead of <a href="https://kotaku.com"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, <a href="https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us"><em>Waypoint</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>; all of which have stepped away from numerical score systems.</p>

<p>This is a good move for <em>Polygon</em> and, I&rsquo;d argue, any video game review site. When it comes to reviews, 5-star scales <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/16/14952434/netflix-five-star-ratings-going-away-thumbs-up-down">are</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/22/youtube-comes-to-a-5-star-realization-its-ratings-are-useless/">worthless</a>, let alone the 10-point variant sites like <em>Polygon</em> previously used. If it were up to me, I&rsquo;d make all review sites use a simple thumbs up/down grade and maybe a &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; for something not terrible nor worth endorsing. A thumbs up tells me the game is worth playing — a <code>7.6/10</code> doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

    <p>Dave Morin, former CEO and co-founder of private social networking app, Path:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Overwhelmed by requests to rebuild a better <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/path">@Path</a>. Considering doing it. If you are interested in working on such an idea, DM me. Let&rsquo;s see if a passionate team forms. If so, we&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Path, if you&rsquo;ve never heard of it, was one of the many social networks launched in the late 2000&rsquo;s, but it had a unique twist: a 50-person network limit. I only used Path for a year or so — it shared a lot of similarities to Instagram in the early days, minus the whole discovery part — but I found it simple and enjoyable. The 50-person limit ended up being a healthy limitation, because when your only connections are current friends and family, there&rsquo;s a real sense of authenticity and calm. Unfortunately, privacy and friend limits don&rsquo;t necessarily help grow a social networking <em>company</em>, and in 2015 Path was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/29/what-is-daum-kakao-and-why-did-it-buy-path/">sold to Korean company Daum Kakao</a>, as the team doubled down on maintaining their traction in the Asian market.</p>

<p>Path&rsquo;s still available today, but they&rsquo;ve lifted their network size limit and haven&rsquo;t done much to the core product since the sale. It&rsquo;s not the same experience that it was in 2010. It&rsquo;s also worth remembering that Path wasn&rsquo;t perfect. Before iOS required apps to request address book permissions, Path <a href="https://www.branded3.com/blog/the-antisocial-network-path-texts-my-entire-phonebook-at-6am/">was caught quietly uploading all of your address book contacts to their servers</a>, and then spamming those numbers as a way to help you make more connections. Scummy.</p>

<p>Still, I think there&rsquo;s room for a mobile-first, affordable (as in <em>paid</em>, because otherwise we&rsquo;ll be right back to the data-selling square one we&rsquo;re in right now with Facebook), limited social network. <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/davemorin/status/976624270477545472">Mr. Morin&rsquo;s tweet</a> generated a lot of enthusiastic replies from investors, developers, and designers all interested in helping get such a project off the ground, but if Facebook&rsquo;s shown us anything, it&rsquo;s that there&rsquo;s a chasm between showing support for a cause on social media and actually <em>doing</em> anything practical.</p>

<p>With Mr. Morin, though, creating a new, better Path could be a real possibility — it just might take a while. Mr. Morin, an ex-Facebooker himself, is currently helping run the venture capital firm he co-founded, Slow Ventures. Slow&rsquo;s modus operandi, if the name didn&rsquo;t give it away, is that &ldquo;the most powerful ideas, companies, and industries aren&rsquo;t created overnight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this point though, it&rsquo;s not about our hypothetical, private social network becoming as powerful as Facebook — it&rsquo;s about having an alternative. A well designed, private, sustainable alternative. In 2010, Path&rsquo;s features and limitations were  interesting — today, they&rsquo;re downright compelling.</p>

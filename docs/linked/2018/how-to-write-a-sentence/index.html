 A sentence is much more than its literal meaning. It is a living line of words where logic and lyric meet &amp;amp;ndash; a piece of both sense and sound, albeit the sound is only heard in the reader&amp;amp;rsquo;s head. Rookie sentence-writers are often too busy worrying about the something they are trying to say and don&amp;amp;rsquo;t worry enough about how that something looks and sounds....">

  <div class="article__content">
    <p>Author Joe Moran had quite a long-winded piece in <em>The Guardian</em> about writing, but this bit is worth saving:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A sentence is much more than its literal meaning. It is a living line of words where logic and lyric meet &ndash; a piece of both sense and sound, albeit the sound is only heard in the reader&rsquo;s head. Rookie sentence-writers are often too busy worrying about the something they are trying to say and don&rsquo;t worry enough about how that something looks and sounds. They look straight past the words into the meaning that they have strong-armed into them. They fasten on content and forget about form &ndash; forgetting that content and form are the same thing, that what a sentence says is the same as how it says it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m all for excellent technical writing (see <a href="https://audaciousfox.net/projects/style-guide/">my style guide</a>), but most of the writings I consider <em>great</em> have an almost lyrical quality to them.</p>

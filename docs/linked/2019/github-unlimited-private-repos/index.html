It&amp;amp;rsquo;s nice that&amp;amp;rsquo;s no longer the case. GitHub becomes a far more attractive service—and stronger social network—when you can host all your work there.
This also makes a lot of sense for where Microsoft might want to take GitHub. The majority of GitHub&amp;amp;rsquo;s future revenue is likely to come in the form of lucrative Enterprise accounts at large companies—something Microsoft is well positioned to push—rather than free (née personal) accounts that upgrade to paid tiers....">

    <p>I&rsquo;ve recommended the code sharing/developer social network GitHub to many people (students and writers primarily), but the recommendation always came with the giant asterisk that everything you published would be public. It&rsquo;s nice that&rsquo;s no longer the case. GitHub becomes a far more attractive service—and stronger social network—when you can host <em>all</em> your work there.</p>

<p>This also makes a lot of sense for where Microsoft might want to take GitHub. The majority of GitHub&rsquo;s future revenue is likely to come in the form of lucrative Enterprise accounts at large companies—something Microsoft is well positioned to push—rather than free (née <em>personal</em>) accounts that upgrade to paid tiers.</p>

<p>(This came at a good time for me too as I wanted to—finally—get my project files for <a href="https://audaciousfox.net/projects/edit/">Edit</a> into their own GitHub repository. Hours after the announcement, I created a new private repository and got everything uploaded. This is going to make my development life so much better. Previously, the whole project was stuffed into a random Dropbox folder. The cobbler&rsquo;s kids have no shoes, right?)</p>

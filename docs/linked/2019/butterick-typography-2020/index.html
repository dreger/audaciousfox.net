<p>But typography—that’s a real decision candidates have to make today, with real money and real consequences. And if I can’t trust you to pick some reasonable fonts and colors, then why should I trust you with the nuclear codes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Website design, color selections, type kerning—Mr. Butterick hits them all. But my favorite bit is his &ldquo;a slice of bacon using a playground slide in an unsafe way&rdquo; description of Andrew Yang&rsquo;s logo. 100% spot on.</p>

<p>Maybe, but I doubt it.</p>

<p>I prefer PES to FIFA. I&rsquo;m not put off by the lack of licenses, kits, and players; I want the best soccer simulator on the market.</p>

<p>I might be in the minority, though. For most fans, gearing up as your favorite player or team is half the fun. If you&rsquo;ve grown up a Liverpool FC fan, playing as Merseyside Red just <em>feels</em> less exciting. Additionally, FIFA has supplemented their core gameplay with several other game modes, which have amassed huge followings. Yes, FIFA Ultimate Team, I&rsquo;m looking at you.</p>

<p>All of this to say some things never change. Even if FIFA 2017 takes a nosedive, it&rsquo;ll still have all the licenses, which is more than enough to sell millions of copies and outsell PES.</p>

<p>Yet, an updated version of our status quo isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. Last year&rsquo;s PES was a great soccer exhibition simulator, and 2017 looks like it&rsquo;s bringing more of the same.</p>

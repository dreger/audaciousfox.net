    <p>Contextual, in-depth look at the URL and its failed alternatives. Zack Bloom, writing for the Eager company blog:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the world of web applications, it can be a little odd to think of the basis for the web being the hyperlink. It is a method of linking one document to another, which was gradually augmented with styling, code execution, sessions, authentication, and ultimately became the social shared computing experience so many 70s researchers were trying (and failing) to create. Ultimately, the conclusion is just as true for any project or startup today as it was then: all that matters is adoption. If you can get people to use it, however slipshod it might be, they will help you craft it into what they need. The corollary is, of course, no one is using it, it doesn’t matter how technically sound it might be. There are countless tools which millions of hours of work went into which precisely no one uses today.</p>

<p>As a URL nerd, if there is such a thing, this fascinated me to no end.</p>

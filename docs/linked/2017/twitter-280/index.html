    <p><a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html">Aliza Rosen and Ikuhiro Ihara</a>, writing for the Twitter blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want every person around the world to easily express themselves on Twitter, so we&rsquo;re doing something new: we&rsquo;re going to try out a longer limit, 280 characters, in languages impacted by cramming (which is all except Japanese, Chinese, and Korean). [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We understand since many of you have been Tweeting for years, there may be an emotional attachment to 140 characters – we felt it, too. But we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In languages that use more complex alphabets, you&rsquo;ll often see single characters that represent multiple words. This Google <a href="https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=tw-ob#auto/ja/Good%20morning%2C%20friends!">translation of &ldquo;Good morning, friends!&rdquo; into Japanese</a> results in only 9 Japanese characters, compared to the 22 characters required for the English equivalent. According to Twitter&rsquo;s research, the current limit leads to less tweeting, which, for a public company with shareholders, is obviously a problem. I disagree, but I understand.</p>
<p>To see what these longer tweets look like, <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/912784057863245824">take a look at this — exactly 280 characters — post</a> from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>Is this a good change? I don&rsquo;t know. 140 characters <em>demands</em> tight editing and brevity. Writing a complex thought in a sentence or two is difficult, but I always saw this limitation as the best feature of Twitter. Even if you scrap the live video, pictures, polls, and direct messaging, a service with a stream of short text snippets would still be uniquely Twitter.</p>
<p>That said, this doesn&rsquo;t appear to be a change that&rsquo;s being rushed out the door. Recode <a href="https://www.recode.net/2015/9/29/11618992/twitter-plans-to-go-beyond-its-140-character-limit">first reported on a possible extension</a> to the character limit back in September 2015, and <a href="https://www.recode.net/2016/1/5/11588480/twitter-considering-10000-character-limit-for-tweets">then again in January 2016</a>, under the internal codename, &ldquo;Beyond 140&rdquo;. And, to be fair, we&rsquo;ve had the 140 limit for over a decade now. I can understand why Twitter would experiment with changing the formula.</p>
<p>However, during these past ten years, tweeting has managed to remain remarkably distinct from &ldquo;blogging&rdquo;, primarily due to a tweet&rsquo;s succinctness. There’s something special about a place where celebrities, professional athletes, and world leaders all have to edit down their thoughts to the core. I worry that a larger character limit will open the door to Twitter feeling (and looking) a little more like every other social network out there, and a little less like Twitter. Becoming more like Facebook might be good for Twitter Inc., but a change like this is irrevocable. Doubling the amount of content a user can post will fundamentally change Twitter; the question is whether it remains recognizable when they&rsquo;re done.</p>

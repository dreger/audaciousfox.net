# The AF Manual of Style

This document serves as the living style guide for [Audacious Fox](http://audaciousfox.com), and I consider it a personalized list of rules that are a superset of those found in the New York Times Manual of Style. The goal of this document is to bring a consistent voice to all the writing on this site.

If you run a journalistic web column, please feel free to remix or copy the contents here for your own personal use. If you feel so obliged, a link back to this page is appreciated, but not required. This document will continue to evolve over time, so please check back occasionally.

## Ideology

If you do any sort of writing, particularly online, you should be using a style guide. Having some sort of reference for how _you_ write will help you make consistent editorial decisions, and it will help bring a level of polish to your work that many miss out on.

At the end of the day, I truly don't care whether you: use the serial comma, prefer "color" to "colour," or never capitalize a proper noun. All that matters is consistency.

### Basic rules

- [How to capitalize your titles](http://titlecapitalization.com).
- Italicize major publications.
- Firstname Lastname; Subsequent references: Mr./Ms. Lastname.
- The [OWL overview on commas](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/owlprint/607/).
- Possessive plural: Attach only an apostrophe: _The Moss' house._
- Colons: Capitalize the first letter of a complete sentence after a colon.

### Quoting and citations

- Appositive phrases should be chosen based on the context of your audience. Used to establish the context of a person, place, or thing without making the reader feel stupid. Ex. "Kyle Dreger, a writer and programmer from Ohio, created the AF Manual of Style, a resource he hopes is copied by bloggers everywhere."
- Don't be a jerk. Always make it clear who and where you're quoting from.

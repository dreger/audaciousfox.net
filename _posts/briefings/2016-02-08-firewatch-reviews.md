Let's wrap a few of these into one post, for brevity. 

John Walker, [writing for Rock Paper Shotgun][rps]: 

> Firewatch is a rare and beautiful creation, that expands the possibilities for how a narrative game can be presented, without bombast or gimmick. Itâ€™s delicate, lovely, melancholy and wistful. And very, very funny. A masterful and entrancing experience.

Hayden Dingman, [in PCWorld's review (3/5 stars)][pcworld]: 

> Firewatch is beautiful. Firewatch is intriguing. But ultimately I don't think Firewatch is very good. At its best, this is a quiet game about two characters struggling with real-life insecurities. But when that's sidelined to make room for a main plot, Firewatch suffers. It's a game perfect for trailers, a game full of excellent dialogue and breathtaking moments and stunning vistas that ultimately amounts to nothing much at all.

Both [Metacritic] and [OpenCritic], sites that aggregate reviews, peg Firewatch at 82/100. I don't expect Firewatch to set the world on fire, but I feel it's going to be one of those games that raises the bar. Knockout graphics, great voice acting. Expect to hear about this one for the next couple of weeks.

Free for all post-2014 Kindles, [a new UI and software update](http://smile.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=13550053011&ref_=pe_2405760_166011780_deveng_ku16). I like the new icon to quickly get to settings, but I dislike that Amazon is beefing up the social side of Kindle. What makes the Kindle so great is it stays away from all that crap. It's just you and the book.

Daring Fireball has the Linked List. Coudal has Fresh Signals. Everyone has some form of _shit I want to link to and comment on_. 

Audacious Fox will have Briefings, and there are several differences. 

Primarily, I will not be linking to the source material in the title of the Briefing. This solves two issues I have with most linked-to content: 

1. The author has to include some additional icon that serves as the permalink to their commentary.
2. Because the headline is also the link to the source material, authors can get lazy and avoid writing any form of lede or introductory. 

Also, outside of the tech pundit world, there's no convention for title-of-post-is-actually-an-external-link. Following this niche convention generally confused the non-techs who I'm writing for. 

The format Briefings will use is more usable, forces me to write better introductions, and lets me not worry about choosing just one link to point to.

Fun, thumping supercut of all the announcements from today's Apple event. The tight editing, upbeat tiempo, and typography are similar to Apple's [40 Years in 40 Seconds][40] video, released earlier this year, but this new one feels more youthful. My favorite bit: "Oh yeah and the headphone jack from over 100 years ago has been removed (shocker)". 

(The heavier San Francisco weight looks great too.)

2016 Speedtest Market Report:

> In fixed broadband, a slow, steady march toward fiber optic networks has the potential to bring a quantum leap in speeds to many U.S. markets in the coming years. However, while ISPs are competing on speed, many consumers in the U.S. still only have a single high speed choice available in their homes. Additionally, provider consolidation presents a big risk that ISPs won’t be motivated to invest in performance gains.

Consolidation and lack of competition are huge problems with the broadband industry, and it’s not going to get better with the new Charter Communications acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, under the new name _Spectrum_.

Kudos to Ookla for publishing the data they collect from their Speedtest.net site. I’ve been using Netflix’s Fast.com lately for download speeds, but Speedtest.net gives me download and upload.

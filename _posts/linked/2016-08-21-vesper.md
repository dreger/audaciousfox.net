Speaking of apps that are going away, next up is Vesper, a note taking app from Q Branch. Reading through the release notes, it seems Q Branch itself — comprised of well-known writer John Gruber, developer Brent Simmons, and designer Dave Wiskus — will also be shutting down within the next month.

I stopped using Vesper about a year ago, but it was a well-designed little app. I really dug the typography, and it's syncing engine was fast and [superbly thought out][vespersync]. Somewhat bizarrely, Vesper even got a decent amount of coverage from Microsoft, since Vesper's syncing engine [was built on Azure's cloud service][azure].

However, Vesper's development came to a halt after Mr. Simmons [departed for the Omni Group][simmons-omni]. He was never replaced, and future releases, including [planned Vesper for Mac][vespermac], were assumedly shelved. So it goes.

**Update:** Per Mr. Gruber, there should be a [full post mortem tomorrow][gruber].

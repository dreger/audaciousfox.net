Speaking of apps that are going away, next up is Q Branch's note taking app Vesper. Reading the release notes for version 2.007, it seems Q Branch itself will also be shutting down.

I stopped using Vesper about a year ago, but it was a fine app. I really dug the typography, and it's syncing engine was fast and [superbly thought out][vespersync]. Somewhat bizarrely, Vesper was even highlighted by Microsoft, since Vesper's syncing engine [was built on Azure's cloud service][azure].

Yet, Vesper's development came to a halt after sole developer Brent Simmons [departed for the Omni Group][simmons-omni] and was never replaced.

John Gruber, says we'll [be getting a full post mortem tomorrow][gruber].

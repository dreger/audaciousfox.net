Does OS X need another Markdown text editor? No.

Is Realmac’s new Markdown editor, [Typed][typed], worth looking at? Yes.

Macs already ships with the purest Markdown experience available: TextEdit in plain text mode. However, there are a number of alternatives:

- iA Writer
- Writer Pro
- Byword
- WriteRoom
- Markdown Pro
- Ulysses
- [LightPaper][lightpaper]
- and Mou to name a few.

Some let you publish to your blog, others let you manage multiple documents, and yet others will highlight individual nouns, verbs, and adjectives for your scrutiny. However, they all do the same basic thing: make Markdown a little more convenient to write.



There are already a number of apps that focus on making Markdown more convient. The Command + K shortcut for creating a link, for example, has become a near universal shortcut.

However, Markdown is, in and of itself, simple and minimalistic. The purest Markdown experience that exists for OS X is to open TextEdit in plain text mode and get to writing.



I’m not sure, because their is currently no shortage of “minimalistic” Markdown text editors. Ignoring that Markdown itself is the Today, Realmac Software [released Typed][typed], their “stunning” markdown text editor.


There are three things that I appreciate about Typed. In no particular order:

- Quick preview
- Empty state quotes
- Sounds

**Quick preview:** Unlike most other Markdown editors, Typed’s here’s-what-your-text-will-render-like mode is subtle and pleasing. Clicking on the eyeglass icon will slide your source to the left, revealing the rendered HTML output. Simple and easy. I just wish that the rendered HTML used the font you chose to write in.

**Empty state quotes:** Similar to Clear, Realmac’s todo list app, a blank page in Typed will

**Sounds:** Here’s where Typed shows its hand and reveals that its not quite as simple as Realmac claims, and that’s a good thing. Typed ships with eight different music tracks, which you can play and change at will. The thing about these tracks is that they are near perfect for writing. If I ever stop using Typed, I’ll still leave the app open just to have the background noise. Sincerely, Realmac nailed this part of the writing experience for me.

I’ve long thought there are twin pillars that a good writer must build: a quiet place for the mind, and never stop reading. The music in Typed removes the track-to-track transition of iTunes (or track-to-ad-to-track of Rdio), and the quotes on every fresh page provide just enough encouragement to handle my mild cases of apathy towards the whole writing craft.

Could you create a soothing, non-intrusive music playlist from your own library? Yes.

Could you keep a text file of inspiring quotes or anectdotes from better writers than you and use those words as inspiration? Yes.

You could do both those things. They may even work better for you than Typed’s built-in variants. But the longer you write, the more you realize that there are rare moments in writing where inspiration meets idea. This is a fragile stage. Typed does its best to protect those moments, and it does so well.

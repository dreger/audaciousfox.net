_Editor's note: The first episode of The Show may very well be its last. I enjoyed doing it, but I got some good feedback from readers that pointed out the written variant of the daily news would be missed. I agree. So, what I think I'll try to do next week is something like this: continue to do the daily news in a written format, and then include a 5-10 minute "director's commentary," in audio form._

[Monument Valley's $1.99 expansion](http://toucharcade.com/2014/11/12/one-star-reviews-flood-monument-valley-following-paid-expansion-release/) &mdash; iOS game Monument Valley 2.0 includes a $1.99 "expansion" in-app purchase, which adds a handful of new levels to the game. Cheapskate iOS users were upset by this and started writing 1-star reviews. Utter nonsense.

[Skype from the browser](http://blogs.skype.com/2014/11/14/please-welcome-skype-for-web-beta/) &mdash; Google Hangouts has been doing this for years, but I'm glad to see that Skype has made its way to the browser as well. 

[BlackBerry launching its 'Classic' phone in December](http://mobilesyrup.com/2014/11/13/blackberry-classic-to-launch-on-december-17th-pre-orders-now-live/) &mdash; If there wasn't a market for BlackBerrys, the company would have died or been sold by now. I'm not sure whether it's niche markets or legacy businesses that are keeping them in business, but _something_ has to be. 

["Can I read that when you're done?"](http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/14/kindle-software-update-lets-you-share-your-amazon-library-with-a-partner-and-more/) &mdash; The most recent Kindle update lets you share your Amazon library with others. 

[T9 "predictive text" keyboard for iOS 8](http://9to5mac.com/2014/11/11/type-nine-keyboard/) &mdash; The only 3rd-party keyboard worth installing. 

["Apple is now worth more than Russiaâ€™s entire stock market"](http://www.cultofmac.com/303084/apple-now-worth-entire-russian-stock-market/) &mdash; We've talked about China and Alibaba recently, but Apple is killing it here in the US too. 

["Ping pong dialogue"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzlQTeUzC4s) &mdash; Seth Meyers' Late Night show did an Aaron Sokin skit, and it was fantastic. 

[Photos from afar](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/11/12/science/space/rosetta-philae-comet-landing.html) &mdash; _The New York Times_ has some breathtaking images from Philae's journey to Comet 67P. 

[Magic](https://magic.neutralcorp.com/) &mdash; Automagically pull in bios, names, and tag-lines from a single email. Doesn't look like it's live yet, but appears to be something from Dustin Curtis, creator of blogging platform Svbtle. It has a [demo page](https://magic.neutralcorp.com/demo) you can try out by typing in `hi@dustincurtis.com`(Curtis' public email). 

[UX and UI](http://designmodo.com/ux-ui/) &mdash; Chris Bank provides a thorough overview of the two acronyms (user-experience and user-interface, if you were wondering) and how "differentiating the two will improve them both." I see a lot of designers assign themselves into either camp UX or camp UI, but I've always just stuck with the "designer" title, when asked. 

[Update Windows now](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms14-066) &mdash; Just by navigating to the wrong website in Internet Explorer, a hacker could execute remote code on your machine. Updates are available; make sure you get them. (via [pxlnv.com](http://pxlnv.com/linklog/ms14-066-critical/))

[The Serial Podcast (yes, again)](http://kottke.org/14/11/serial) &mdash; More and more folks are looking forward to Thursdays and the new episode of Serial that comes with it. If you haven't listened in yet, go start with episode #1. Give it 20 minutes of your weekend, you won't be disappointed. 

_Enjoy your weekends, and we'll see you Monday. Remember to [send me](/about) the name of your favorite iOS game, if you're interested in me buying you a copy of Monument Valley. Cheers, and good night._

_Editor's note: Trying numbers-as-links this time around. I feel it helps keep the list simple and easier to scan, but that could be just me._

[00](https://twitter.com/robinkwong/status/527128999584333824
) &mdash; US broadband: Robin Kwong mapped the US "digital divide". Lots of broadband concentration in the southeast, not so much in the northwest. 

[01](http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/10/28/30-days-later-a-month-of-hong-kong-pro-democracy-protests-in-photos/) &mdash; China: A month of photos from the Hong Kong protests. For the Americans, like myself, who feel somewhat geographically insulated (we're flanked by two oceans), these images help make the protests in China feel more immediate. 

Joke: The past, the present, and the future walked into a bar. It was tense. &mdash; via [Geoffrey K. Pullum](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=15495).

[02](http://www.kirklennon.com/a/applepay.html) &mdash; Apple: Kirk Lennon says Apple Pay is incredibly secure, since each transaction is authorized with a one-time use unique token. And unlike credit card numbers, thieves can't steal tokens from store databases. 

[03](http://www.businessinsider.com/wal-mart-heres-why-we-dont-support-apple-pay-2014-10) &mdash; Apple: Along with CVS, Rite Aid, and a handful of others, WAL-MART isn't currently accepting Apple Pay.  WAL-MART may be in a better position to fight Apple Pay given their demographic, but the company's quoted reasoning is still shoddy. 

[04](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/28/w3c-declares-html5-standard-done/) &mdash; HTML: 17 years later, HTML 5 replaces HTML 4. Work now begins on HTML 5.1. `<blink>` tag still dead. 

[05](http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/404) &mdash; Lapham's Quarterly has the best 404 page. Lovely copy.  

[06](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29802581) &mdash; Google is the website you search the internet with. Google X is the secret team at Google that's creating a way to detect cancer through "disease-detecting nanoparticles."

[07](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/youtube-weighing-new-subscription-service/) &mdash; YouTube: People watch more online videos than TV, and YouTube wants to capitalize with paid subscriptions. If I could pay $5 a month to never see a YouTube ad again, I'm in. 

[08](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/28/us-usa-fcc-video-idUSKBN0IH29T20141028) &mdash; Internet video: The FCC is going to vote on "leveling the playing field," in regards to online video, to encourage competition in the market. The more pressure on monopolistic cable companies, the better. 

[09](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/28/7084497/ftc-sues-att-over-unlimited-data-throttling) &mdash; Phones: AT&T's "unlimited" data plans aren't really unlimited, and the FTC is gearing up to sue. I remain dubious of anything labeled "unlimited" in terms of data in the US. 

[10](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/27/7068363/apple-imac-with-retina-5k-display-review) &mdash; Holy pixels: The Apple iMac with Retina 5k review. Good: the screen, holy crap the screen. Bad: most websites don't have the image / video resources to take advantage of all the pixels. 

_Sidebar: If you wonder why The Verge takes off points for "doesn't work as a secondary display," it's because past iMac models [could do just that](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3924?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US). Seems silly to me, though; the iMac is a whole computer, not an external monitor._

[11](http://droplr.com/droplr-for-mac-4-2-for-yosemite/) &mdash; Apps: Version 4.2 of Droplr for Mac is out, and it has a make-your-own-gif feature, which I will be abusing in our company's [Slack](http://slack.com) chat. 

[12](http://www.cultofmac.com/301221/taco-bells-new-iphone-app-future-fast-food/) &mdash; Apps: Taco Bell launched a new iPhone app that makes ordering fourth meal stupid simple. I'm glad they let me graduate before shipping this. 

[13](https://medium.com/message/72-hours-of-gamergate-e00513f7cf5d) &mdash; #Gamergate: Andy Baio dug through 316,669 tweets to procure understated context for the #gamergate hashtag. The "network visualization" graph is particularly striking. 

[14](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/10/28/359564982/pope-says-god-not-a-magician-with-a-magic-wand) &mdash; Science and Religion: Pope Francis: “The Big Bang, which today we hold to be the origin of the world, does not contradict the intervention of the divine creator but, rather, requires it. [...] When we read about Creation in Genesis, we run the risk of imagining God was a magician, with a magic wand able to do everything. But that is not so."

[15](http://toolsandtoys.net/guides/the-tools-and-toys-paperless-guide/) &mdash; Going paperless: This is something that I've wanted to try for our home office, but I always thought document scanners were ugly. Seeing the Doxie lineup, particularly the Doxie Go, is making me reconsider.

[16](http://patrickrhone.com/2014/10/28/the-right-words/) &mdash; “It whispers tapioca:” Patrick Rhone: "It is moments like this that I am reminded why I am a writer. I’m in love with and in awe of the power of language." Same feelings here. 

[17](http://www.soccerbyives.net/2014/10/announces-shortlist-klinsmann.html) &mdash; FIFA: Jurgen Klinsmann has been named as one of 10 coaches to make the 2014 World Coach of the Year shortlist. I'd give it to him in a heartbeat (subs John Brooks and Julian Green both get goals?!); the USMNT's coaching staff did an excellent job this year. 

[18](http://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2014/10/2014-national-geographic-photo-contest-part-ii/100840/) &mdash; The 2014 National Geographic Photo Contest: #6, #12, and #24 are fantastic. Via [JG](http://www.thenewsprint.co/2014/10/28/the-2014-national-geographic-photo-contest/).

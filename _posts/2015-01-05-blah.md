_Editor's note: Hope you all had a safe and fun end to 2014, as my family did. With the holidays behind us, and our puppy's schedule figured out, AF is now taking a front seat in my plans for 2015. Here's to you, good readers._

"[Making marriage the cornerstone, rather than the capstone, of your adult life](http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/03/the-case-for-getting-married-young/274293/)" &mdash; Excellent and relevant piece from Karen Prior for _The Atlantic_. 

[It just works?](http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground) &mdash; Marco Arment, writing about how Apple's software is more buggy and unstable than it's ever been. He postulates how this current state might be, in part, caused by Apple's marketing team, which is pushing the limits of an already unmaintainable software release schedule. 

"[Ring-Rang](http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2000_03_landfall.html)" &mdash; Forgive the full-width margins, but Steven Pinker's piece on Irregular Verbs is a delightful read for any language lover. 

[Reading with an audience](http://www.wired.com/2015/01/mark-zuckerberg-book-club/) &mdash; Mark Zuckerberg has started an worldwide book club, and they're reading _The End of Power_ as their first book. Me? I'm finishing _Casino Royale_, then _Flatland_.

[Cheap, easy to clean, and portable](http://shawnblanc.net/2014/12/the-special-aeropress/) &mdash; Shawn Blanc wrote up the reasons he loves his AeroPress. Two years into owning my own, and I wholeheartedly agree. 

[All The Things](http://fiftyfootshadows.net/2015/01/05/all-the-things/) &mdash; John Carey says what I've been wanting to write for a while now. Go read his whole post; it's not long, but honest words generally need less time to make their point. 

[Making good software is hard](http://www.panic.com/blog/the-2014-panic-report/) &mdash; Panic Inc. makes some of my go-to apps, including Transmit and Prompt. They've written up the annual Panic Report, and they've written a tad more about their business than usual. It's a good piece, if you've ever wondered what a successful software shop goes through in a year.

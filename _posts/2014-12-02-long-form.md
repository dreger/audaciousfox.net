The past few weeks of “tab dumping” have been fun, but I want to start mixing in some long-form writing. I must be careful not to let the ease of curating get in the way of creating; add to the conversation, don’t just point and look. 

I’m not done collecting the news, but expect some longer pieces this week, with an end-of-week link roundup. Come this weekend, I’ll reassess to see what works best and how each type of content fits into my goals for AF.

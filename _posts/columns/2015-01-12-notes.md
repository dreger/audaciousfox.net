The past few months have been great for AF. Readership has increased every week, and I've managed to

## Some updates

- New day / night theme, which can be activated by tapping on the sun icon, in the top right. If you've already seen this theme switcher, I encourage you to check it out again, because I just pushed tweaked versions of the color palettes, and I think they're great.
- Signals now have their own homepage, which helps keep the front page focus on my long-form articles.
- Speaking of Signals, the publishing date will try to follow a MWF scheme. I try to be deliberate in what I share with each issue, so there may be some cases where there's nothing worth bothering you with.
- One of my goals has been keeping the cost of this site low. To that end, I've dropped H&Co's Whitney typeface, which was great, and I've switched to Open Sans; a font family that archives the geometric sans-serif look I was going for.
- This site is now published off of GitHub pages. Since GitHub has built-in support for Jekyll, the engine I use to publish here, it makes things easy. And free.
- AF is not my full-time job; rather, writing here is a labor of love. The content here will always be free, but I'm introducing something new, for those who want to help support the site (more later).

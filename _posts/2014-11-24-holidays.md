_A letter from the Editor:_ With the upcoming holiday, and work that needs to get done beforehand, the AF printing press will be shutting down this week. Enjoy the break!

Although there won't be any formal issues, I pledge to make use of [the tweet-o-sphere](http://twitter.com/kyledreger) as an intermediary for the news and your eyeballs. Over the next six days, it will be the familiar AF format you enjoy, just with a little more constrained language. 

Oh, and absolutely zero chat acronyms in my tweetitular messages; I'm not an animal. Cheers, all. 

_Feel free to [let me know](http://audaciousfox.com/about) how you've been enjoying, or not enjoying, the AF format so far. I'm particularly curious what you think about the distribution of AF. To keep things simple, I only have RSS, but would an email newsletter or dedicated Twitter feed be appropriate? Let me know. As always, thanks for reading._

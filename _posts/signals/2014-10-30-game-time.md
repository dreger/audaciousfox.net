_Editor's note: Little by little, compiling these posts is getting easier. I've also found that it is a nice way to decompress at the end of the day._

[Tim Cook: "I'm proud to be gay"](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-30/tim-cook-im-proud-to-be-gay) &mdash; Resonating words from the CEO of Apple.

[Google goodbye](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/30/7135549/android-creator-andy-rubin-is-leaving-google) &mdash; Andy Rubin, the Google exec who helped create Android, is leaving the company after nearly a decade.

["Band," "Watch," and "Wear"](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/30/7132901/wearing-the-microsoft-band-is-this-the-next-big-thing-in-fitness) &mdash; Microsoft joins Apple and Google in the wearables game. The MS Band resembles the Fitbit Force, but with a nicer screen. Accompanying app looks decent.

[LOCO](http://www.tacobell.com/home) &mdash; Taco Bell has replaced their home page with the message: "the new way to Taco Bell isn't on the internet, it's on #onlyintheapp." Bold and crazy. The app currently sits at #21 and #180 on the "Top Free" lists for the App Store and Google Play respectively.

[ "Hard work on three, together on six."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6S1JoCSVNU) &mdash; NBA basketball is back and so are the Cavs.  I'm currently listening to the game (going on at Cleveland, against the New York Nicks), and it's feels good to have LeBron back. He's a different guy than he was five years ago, and I think that's a good thing. The link is to an ad that Nike did for Cleveland, and it's just great.

[Chicago's four-block stretch of streets where drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians are all equal](http://www.fastcoexist.com/3037471/on-a-new-shared-street-in-chicago-there-are-no-sidewalks-no-lights-and-no-signs) &mdash; My mother used to have a saying, "it doesn't matter if you have the right away, you still don't want to get hit." This is going to be one hell of an experiment.

[Dribbblin'](http://blog.dribbble.com/2014/10/30/tales-from-the-script.html) &mdash; Dribbble, the show-and-tell community for designers, just tweaked the letterforms in their logo, and it looks much better. I've visited dribbble for four years now, and the inconsistent baseline always bugged me.

[Monsters and Thieves](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3794-monsters-and-thieves) &mdash; Anytime you can weave Mary Shelley and Picasso into the same post, it's going to be a good one. Typography, design, and practical advice; such a good piece by Nathan Kontny.  

[Retina iMac, seven days in](http://shawnblanc.net/2014/10/a-week-with-the-retina-imac/) &mdash; Shawn Blanc: "My review of the new Retina iMac could be said as one word: sensational." I'd use a similar word to describe Mr. Blanc's review. I also find it interesting that Mr. Blanc switched from a laptop / external monitor setup to a desktop / iPad one. I'd like to try that, but first I'd like to get that iMac.

[$9.59 Billion later](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/30/lenovo-has-completed-the-2-91-billion-acquisition-of-motorola-from-google/) &mdash; First, Google bought Motorola for $12.5 Billion. Then, three years later, Google sold Motorola to Lenovo for $2.91 Billion. A weird situation, particularly since Motorola is the company behind Google's new [Nexus 6](https://www.google.com/nexus/6/).

[Calculated](http://shapeof.com/archives/2014/10/pcalc_and_the_app_store.html) &mdash; The App Store review team can be more flip-floppity than the pancakes I made this morning.

[Design is about compromises](http://toolsandtoys.net/keys-to-go/) &mdash; Logitech has a new super-slim wireless keyboard. I like the colors and the marketed durability, but I'm skeptical about actually typing on keys that thin. Will there be any tactile feedback, or are you better off just using the on-screen keyboard?

[New Uniform Wares lineup](http://www.uniformwares.com/watches-and-timepieces/) &mdash; If you had me design my ideal watch, it would look almost exactly like the Brushed steel Uniform Wares M40. Via [JG](http://www.thenewsprint.co/2014/10/30/the-all-new-uniform-wares-timepiece-lineup/).

["Smart Comes Full Circle"](http://www.lg.com/global/gwatch/index.html#main) &mdash; The new Android Wear watch from LG looks anything by smart. Also, reduce your browser size down to a narrow width; I can't believe the site isn't responsive.

[Skype for iOS update](http://venturebeat.com/2014/10/30/skype-for-iphone-now-lets-you-save-and-delete-photos-gets-avatar-people-and-chat-improvements/) &mdash; I'd prefer to use FaceTime, but Skype consistently does better with video compression and with handling flaky internet connections. Just ask [@cbdurr](http://twitter.com/cbdurr).

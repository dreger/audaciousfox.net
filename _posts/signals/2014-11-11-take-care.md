["There was a great war, and now it is over"](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2014/11/there-was-war-great-war-and-now-it-is.html) &mdash; A poignant letter home, from lieutenant Lewis Plush, after the end of World War I. 

[$2 Billion and Counting](http://www.spotifyartists.com/2-billion-and-counting/) &mdash; Spotify's tongue-in-cheek response to Taylor Swift pulling all her records from the service.  

["A Time For Things," by Patrick Rhone:](http://patrickrhone.com/2014/11/11/a-time-for-things/)

> Everything — EVERY THING — happens within the boundaries of time. Even if you don’t decide the time up front, even if you don’t schedule the time, the thing gets done at a time or not at all. And, when it comes to things, capturing is not committing. Capturing is parking. Capturing is waiting. Capturing is wishing. Deciding the when — scheduling the time — is committing. Doing the thing, is completing.

[Writer Emergency Pack](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/913409803/writer-emergency-pack-helping-writers-get-unstuck) &mdash; A Kickstarter project for 26 illustrated cards that help writers get "unstuck" from writer's block. I also recommend reddit's [/r/writingprompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/). (via [df](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/11/11/writer-emergency-pack))

[The Microsoft Lumia](http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/24/7056495/microsoft-lumia-replaces-nokia-lumia-official) &mdash; First Lumia phone sans-Nokia branding. Extraordinarily plain. 

[Codrops' Drag-and-Drop interaction demo](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/11/11/drag-and-drop-interaction-ideas/) &mdash; I have no idea how they do it, but Codrops consistently has some of the most polished HTML / CSS demos I see on the web. 

[How do you sell a $5,000 watch?](http://www.campaignlive.com/article/apple-watch-its-time-new-ad-designs/1321477) &mdash; The Apple Watch is a device very different from anything Apple has previously done, and it will require advertising of that same direction.  

[You should be paying attention to China](http://recode.net/2014/11/11/alibaba-just-sold-more-than-9-billion-in-goods-in-one-day/) &mdash; Alibaba, think Amazon of China, just did over $9 Billion in sales for the China's equivalent of Cyber Monday. Absolutely insane. 

[@China: An easy way to start learning more about China](https://twitter.com/china) &mdash; I've been following this Twitter account for about a week, and it's helped me stay current with Chinese news. 

["The Importance of Looking a Little Funny"](http://www.acontinuouslean.com/2014/11/11/importance-funny/) &mdash; Jake Gallagher: "French director/actor Jacques Tati’s biography states that he was born in 1907 and died in 1982, but the truth is Tati was a man immune to time." Lots of pictures, and a fun read.

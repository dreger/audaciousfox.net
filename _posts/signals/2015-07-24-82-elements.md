> When I was sent away to a boarding school as a child of 6, at the outset of the Second World War, numbers became my friends; when I returned to London at 10, the elements and the periodic table became my companions. Times of stress throughout my life have led me to turn, or return, to the physical sciences, a world where there is no life, but also no death.

That's Dr. Oliver Sacks for the _Times_, where he [reflects on the elements of his life](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/opinion/my-periodic-table.html) as he battles cancer. If you liked his piece, Dr. Sacks also wrote one of my favorite books: [_Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood_](http://amzn.com/0375704043).

 As I was shopping around the internet for holiday gifts, I came across these beautiful playing cards by Robert Padbury. I mean, just look at them. Unfortunately, they're not currently for sale, but you can jump on [waiting list](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/padbury/atelier-playing-cards/posts/959844), if you're interested.

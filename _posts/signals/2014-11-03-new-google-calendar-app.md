[New Google Calendar app](https://www.google.com/landing/calendar/) &mdash; 
 I've been incredibly impressed with Google's [Material design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) spec and execution. All their apps are beginning to have a cohesive feeling, across both mobile and desktop devices. I still prefer the iOS aesthetic, as I feel it's more flexible for iOS designers to be creative, but we're reaching that point where Google is making better designs faster than Apple is web services.

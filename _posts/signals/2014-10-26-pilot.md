_Editor's note &mdash; I'm going to try something this week, to see if it sticks. [Tab Dump](http://tabdump.com), a daily collection of interesting links, recently shut down, and I want to try my hand at it. My foci are: links that matter, simple summaries, and brevity in my own comments. Each article will correspond with the past day's news. Thanks for reading, and here are some links from this past week:_

[The Zombie iPad](https://brooksreview.net/2014/10/zombie-ipad/) &mdash; Ben Brooks argues that keeping the old iPad Mini (sans-Retina) around helps lower the bar to entry for new iOS users. I think that non-Retina screens look like garbage, but the cheaper prices ($249) can't be argued against.

[The Audi A6 Prestige 3.0 TFSI](http://www.minimallyminimal.com/blog/audi-a6-prestige-30-tfsi) &mdash; I know very little about cars, but Andrew Kim's photo review helps me appreciate the beauty.

[Google's Inbox](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/10/an-inbox-that-works-for-you.html) &mdash; Google revealed a "completely different type of inbox, designed to focus on what really matters." Think [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/) but designed by Google. You have to request an Inbox invitation, but I got mine within a day.

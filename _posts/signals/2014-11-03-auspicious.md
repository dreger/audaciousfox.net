_Editor's note: Welcome back. How did you spend your [extra hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) this weekend?_

[Clocks keep better time in space](http://www.npr.org/2014/11/03/361069820/new-clock-may-end-time-as-we-know-it) &mdash; There's a clock that is so sensitive that it can detect changes in time itself. This whole article is just... something else.

[Taylor Swift pulls her music from Spotify](http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/taylor-swift-announces-world-tour-and-pulls-her-music-from-spotify/) &mdash; With music streaming being so popular, and paying less royalties, bigger names will occasionally pull their records to help drive demand and sales for a new album. But Ms. Swift didn't just pull her latest record, she pulled _all_ of them.  

[My Grandma the Poisoner](http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/my-gandma-the-poisoner-0000474-v21n10) &mdash; The title says it all for this one. Just an excellent essay by John Reed. Don't start reading unless you have some time; it took me about 20 minutes and a nice cup of coffee to finish this one.

[Practical knots for everyday uses](http://allaboutknots.blogspot.mx/2013/07/1-practical-knots-for-everyday-uses.html) &mdash; You may not be able to remember the last time you tied a knot that didn't sit on your shoes, but that doesn't matter. It's worth your time to learn at least four out of the nine knots the author lists in this article. Then go learn how to make fire without matches. Seriously.

[New Google Calendar app](https://www.google.com/landing/calendar/) &mdash; I've been incredibly impressed with Google's [Material design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) spec and execution. All their apps are beginning to have a cohesive feeling, across both mobile and desktop devices. I still prefer the iOS aesthetic, as I feel it's more flexible for iOS designers to be creative, but we're reaching that point where Google is making better designs faster than Apple is web services.  

[Tim Cook's interview with _The Wall Street Journal_](http://online.wsj.com/articles/apples-tim-cook-answers-the-skeptics-1414962373) &mdash; Some comments on Apple Watch, Apple Pay, and how Apple can't read your iMessages.

[CNET is launching a physical magazine](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/business/media/technology-website-cnet-to-jump-from-screen-to-page.html) &mdash; Because the print industry is doing so well right now.

[Growing Google](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/03/larry-page-google-dont-be-evil-sergey-brin) &mdash; Chief Executive Larry Page feels that Google has 'outgrown' its original mission statement of “organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” I agree; Google's scope has expanded far beyond just cataloging links and webpages.

[Skype Translator demo](http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/03/skype-translator-preview/) &mdash; Microsoft is demoing a real time speech translation (via on-screen captions) for video chats over Skype. Nothing is available for the public yet, unless you get approved for the trial, but this is downright impressive technology.

[Polling and cell phones](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/11/03/pollsters-used-to-worry-that-cellphone-users-would-skew-results-these-days-not-so-much/) &mdash; An interesting look at how the rise of cell phones, and subsequent decrease in home phone owners, almost threw political pollsters for a loop.

[Can you hear me now?](http://recode.net/2014/11/03/verizon-and-att-plan-lte-call-interoperability-by-2015/) &mdash; AT&T and Verizon want to get Voice over LTE (VoLTE) working for calls made between the two networks by 2015. Currently, to take advantage of the higher-quality calls VoLTE provides, both parties have to be on the same network.  

[The Hellbrand Leather Field Notes Cover](http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/hellbrand-leather-field-notes-cover/) &mdash; If you know anyone who loves Field Notes notebooks, Tools and Toys has the perfect stocking stuffer.

[The IKEA Sit/Stand desk review](http://gizmodo.com/ikea-sit-stand-desk-review-i-cant-believe-how-much-i-l-1652445999) &mdash; I use a standing desk at work and absolutely love it. Once we save up some money, I'd consider getting a standing desk for our home office, but I'm not sure whether I'd pick up Shawn Blanc's recommend [Jarvis](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HRFEIF4/ref=nosim&tag=toolsandtoys-20), or this IKEA one.

Reeves Wiedema, writing for Popular Mechanics: 

> Bill Dicke taps his desk anxiously, leans toward his computer monitor, and stares at the word "quarantine." He's trying to write a headline for a story on the arrival of Ebola in the United States, slated for tomorrow's front page. As assistant editor on the news desk, Dicke is among the last pair of eyes on the paper's front page and writes a lot of headlines. "Quarantine" is the best word, but at ten letters it has too many characters for a single column above the fold. The paper's first deadline of the night is in a half-hour. Dicke frowns. "There are seven pages for foreign, eight for national, and we're supposed to close them in some kind of order before nine o'clock," Dicke, who wears glasses and has a white beard, mutters. "None of the pages are even set." He rolls up the sleeves of his blue oxford shirt.

Just an excellent feature. It will take you a while to read this one, but it's perfect for the weekend and a cup of coffee.

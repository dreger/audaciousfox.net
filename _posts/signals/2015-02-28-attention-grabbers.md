Kyle Reese on the state of online news content and sensational headlines:

> It's like a replay of the story of the boy who cried wolf every time I want to see what's going on in the world, and I think any serious journalist should recognize that by constantly creating misleading headlines they are doing their readers and the public at large a huge disservice. How should a consumer know when a specific article really is a must-read and when it is just an article.  

My position is: if your headline looks sloppy, why should I believe your story isn't?

 I don't own this journal, but I love the idea of breaking my daily journaling into two sessions: one in the morning and one right before bed; two sessions help enforce perspective. If, like me, you use [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) or write your entries digitally, you can just copy the prompts from the FMJ and fill them in throughout the day.

[Obama pushes for municipal broadband](http://www.vox.com/2015/1/14/7546865/obama-municipal-broadband-fcc) &mdash; Having the cable companies compete with local governments is a good thing, in the context of broadband. I'd much rather pay $70 for 100 Mbps, instead of the 15 Mbps I get now. 

[Real time, real world translation](http://googletranslate.blogspot.com/2015/01/hallo-hola-ola-to-new-more-powerful_14.html) &mdash; The new Google Translate app can use your camera to perform real time translation on signs, maps, and more. Really cool, and great for impressing your Spanish teacher, but It should be noted that [Word Lens](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/word-lens/id383463868?mt=8) was doing this [back in 2010](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/dec/20/word-lens-app-translates), and this was on the iPhone 4. 

[An overview of Ethos, Pathos, and Logos](http://courses.durhamtech.edu/perkins/aris.html) &mdash; Learn a little greek, become a better writer. Knowing the different argumentative appeals, and when to use them, is an incredibly powerful tool for both written and oral communication.

[Two years at community college](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/opinion/tom-hanks-on-his-two-years-at-chabot-college.html?_r=0) &mdash; Tom Hanks, in an op-ed for the _New York Times_: 

> A public speaking class was unforgettable for a couple of reasons. First, the assignments forced us to get over our self-consciousness. Second, another student was a stewardess, as flight attendants called themselves in the â€™70s. She was studying communications and was gorgeous. She lived not far from me, and when my VW threw a rod and was in the shop for a week, she offered me a lift to class. I rode shotgun that Monday-Wednesday-Friday totally tongue-tied. Communicating with her one on one was the antithesis of public speaking.

[A Review of the GORUCK GR2](http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/the-goruck-gr2/) &mdash; This GORUCK GR2 review, by Alvaro Serrano, is sublime.  I may just start forwarding my [review of the (similar) GORUCK GR1](http://kyledreger.com/archives/14113-goruck-gr1.html), because Mr. Serrano's version eclipses mine, in all possible ways. After reading through this piece twice, I'm not sure which is better: the photography, the writing style, or the way the Tools and Toys design handles long-form content. 

[Upgrade hiatus](http://mattgemmell.com/a-final-laptop/) &mdash; Matt Gemmell, writing about how most of us can get along just fine with our current devices. Do you really need to upgrade your laptop or iPhone, whenever Cupertino refreshes their product line? 

[Facebook for Work](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/facebook-looks-to-the-workplace-for-future-growth/) &mdash; I'm curious to see if this works, since there's already a a strong negative connotation around using Facebook at work. However, considering that most (primarily large) company intranets are utter crap, there may be room to steal some marketshare. On a side note, using white, instead of blue, for the header and iOS navigation is both sharp looking and practical. 

[Great Glass](http://thenewsprint.co/2015/01/13/great-glass/) &mdash; The difference between a "good" camera lens and a "great" camera lens is remarkable; however, I know nothing about either. Thankfully, Joshua Ginter is skilled at both photography and typing, so he's got me covered. 

[Project Ara-mazing](http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/14/7547529/google-project-ara-prototype-hands-ontf) &mdash; What if you could swap out your smartphone's battery, camera, and processor for their newest respective versions? That's what Google's Project Ara aims to do: make phone components modular. The Ara team is one year into their two year tenure, so expect to see an actual product, sometime next year.

 Two things: 1.) Google Glass, in its current form, is failing hard, and 2.) Tony Fadell, "Father of the iPod," is a great choice for this project. But, honestly, I just don't see the appeal of Google Glass. I really don't. I'm open to the idea of augmenting my peripheral view with computers, but $1,500 for crappy battery life and look-at-me aesthetics isn't the way to do it.

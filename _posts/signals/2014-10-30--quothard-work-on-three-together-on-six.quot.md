 NBA basketball is back and so are the Cavs.  I'm currently listening to the game (going on at Cleveland, against the New York Nicks), and it's feels good to have LeBron back. He's a different guy than he was five years ago, and I think that's a good thing. The link is to an ad that Nike did for Cleveland, and it's just great.

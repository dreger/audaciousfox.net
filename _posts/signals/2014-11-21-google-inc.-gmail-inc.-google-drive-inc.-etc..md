[Google Inc., Gmail Inc., Google Drive Inc., Etc.](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/in-europe-a-resolution-to-break-up-google/) &mdash; 
 The European Parliament have called for a resolution that asks Google to unbundle search from the rest of its portfolio of products. This reminds me of 2003, when the European Union ordered Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without Windows Media Player installed; however, I'd argue that the web is far less prone to lock in than operating systems are.

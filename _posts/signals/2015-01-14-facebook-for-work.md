 I'm curious to see if this works, since there's already a strong negative connotation around using Facebook at work. However, considering that most (primarily large) company intranets are utter crap, there may be room to steal some marketshare. On a side note, using white, instead of blue, for the header and iOS navigation is both sharp looking and practical.

[Monument Valley&apos;s $1.99 expansion](http://toucharcade.com/2014/11/12/one-star-reviews-flood-monument-valley-following-paid-expansion-release/) &mdash; 
 iOS game Monument Valley 2.0 includes a $1.99 "expansion" in-app purchase, which adds a handful of new levels to the game. Cheapskate iOS users were upset by this and started writing 1-star reviews. Utter nonsense.

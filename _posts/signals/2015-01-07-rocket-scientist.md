 Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX CEO, recently did a Reddit AMA (ask me anything), where the community could vote up questions for Mr. Musk to answer. My favorites responses include those related to: [computer singularity](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/cnfq7rp), [a great daily habit](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/cnfpv7q), [advice from Churchill](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/cnfsjx3), and [the cost of intellectual context switching](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/cnfput4).

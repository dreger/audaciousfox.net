I'm digging the new Material Design language that Google is implementing across their iOS apps, and the [new Google Calendar](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2015/03/google-calendar-for-iphone-its-about.html) is a great example. But what's with [this janky, truncated app name](https://twitter.com/dreger/status/575461699374817280)?

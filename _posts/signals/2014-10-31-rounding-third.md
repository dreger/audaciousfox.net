_Editor's note: Now that I have some practice picking stories, writing about them, and publishing these posts, I'm working on refining my news sources. I currently go through about 700 articles each day, but I have a feeling that number could be cut in half with higher quality outlets. Happy weekend, and see you Monday._

[A happy font family](http://www.frerejones.com/about/press/2014-10-30/) &mdash; Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones have resolved their legal dispute, which started [back in January](http://kyledreger.com/archives/14017-frere-jones-sues-hoefler.html). Hoefler will continue to lead H&Co., and Frere-Jones looks to "return to design work and to launch my own type design practice in the new year."

[Slack valued at $1.12 Billion](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/10/31/one-year-old-business-software-maker-slack-valued-at-1-12-billion/) &mdash; One of the few startup valuations that I actually agree with. Slack has completely changed the way teams at my company communicate. It's simply sublime.

[Interview with Slack CEO Stuart Butterfield](http://fortune.com/2014/10/31/stewart-butterfield-slack-billion/) &mdash; Mr. Butterfield: "I think it’s hard in the moment to know exactly why it’s [Slack's] working. Just like Google vs. Alta Vista. At the moment it was difficult to explain, but it’s relatively easy to put your finger on it retroactively." Smart company, run by a smart guy.

[When 911 doesn't work](https://www.fcc.gov/blog/technology-transitions-consumers-matter-most) &mdash; Dying technology stacks and mismanaged upgrades are affecting the reliability of the 911 service. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler wants to fix this.

[Virgin Galactic's "Space Tourism" SpaceShipTwo crashes](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/science/virgin-galactics-spaceshiptwo-crashes-during-test-flight.html) &mdash; One pilot dead, another seriously injured. Sad news.

[BlackBerry adds disappearing messages to BBM, continues to have identity crisis](http://www.cultofandroid.com/70099/bbm-gets-snapchat-inspired-self-destructing-messages/) &mdash; I'm hesitant to take this as a sign that BlackBerry's messaging app is growing; rather, that BBM remains one of the most mismanaged products I've ever seen.

[Current for Mac](http://currentformac.com/) &mdash; A Facebook client for OS X. I rarely use Facebook (and when I do, it's through the Facebook Paper iOS app), but Current looks really well designed. Available on the App Store for just $2 cheap.

[SugarString by Verizon](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/10/31/is-a-news-site-a-news-site-if-its-published-by-verizon/) &mdash; Verizon Wireless' marketing department has launched a website to publish "thoughtful tech-focused stories that track humanity's climb towards the new next." Verizon Wireless' _marketing_ department. Marketing.

Q: What do ghosts eat for supper?

[The CurrentC user experience](http://qz.com/287566/this-terrible-cvs-receipt-shows-why-apple-pay-has-little-to-fear-from-retailers/) &mdash; Or lack thereof, rather.

[The Newsprint Day One review](http://www.thenewsprint.co/2014/10/31/day-one/) &mdash; Joshua Ginter does a great job reviewing one of my favorite iOS apps.

[Department of Homeland security employees put $30,000 worth of Starbucks on government credit card](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2014/10/31/report-dhs-employees-put-30000-worth-of-starbucks-on-government-credit-card/) &mdash; Too bad that only gets you, like, five Grande Frappuccinos.

[More coffee](http://www.geekwire.com/2014/starbucks-ceo-howard-schultz-says-coffee-company-playing-offense-order-crack-code-mobile-plans-food-beverage-delivery-service/) &mdash; John Cook: "Starbucks said today that roughly 16 percent of its U.S. sales now occur through a mobile device, with the company now handling about seven million mobile payments each week. It also controlled about 90 percent of all mobile payment transactions last year." Insane. Via [Pixel Envy](http://pxlnv.com/linklog/starbucks-mobile-transactions/)

_That's it! Have a nice weekend, all. I like Twitter, so feel free to [say hello there](http://twitter.com/kyledreger) or by [email](/about)._

Giovanni Donelli [hits the nail on the head](http://blog.astropad.com/good-design-is-honest/): when Tim Cook brought up Christy Turlington Burns for Apple's "Spring Forward" keynote, it felt awkward and scripted. I don't think Apple intended it to come off that way, but it did. That segment seemed as though Mr. Cook was trying to use Ms. Turlington as an example of _every_ potential Apple Watch wearer: the athlete, the mother, the successful businesswoman, the donates-their-time person. I think Apple earnestly, and rightly, wanted to promote Ms. Turlington, but their execution felt forced.

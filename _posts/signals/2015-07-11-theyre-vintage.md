Everyone seems to be talking about online advertisement and webpage weight, so I ran in the opposite direction and spent an hour browsing [vintage print ads](http://www.adclassix.com/index.html). I particularly love [these ones](http://www.buzzfeed.com/copyranter/all-the-great-1960s-volkswagen-ads) from Volkswagon (that copywriting!) and [this classic](https://twitter.com/Brilliant_Ads/status/373564089622360064) from Porsche.

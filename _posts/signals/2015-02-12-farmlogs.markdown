Sam Altman, president of start-up incubator Y Combinator: 

> FarmLogs is a great example of a company that started out with a seemingly boring idea--a way for farmers to store their data in the cloud--and has developed into a way for farmers to run their entire farm, gather all the data about a particular piece of farmland, and optimize production.  The company is now used by 20% of US row crop farms, and those farms are all more productive than they were without the software.

Not another social network with filters and badges; rather, a company that is using software to solve actual human problems. This is the type of start-up story I love to read about.

[$9.59 Billion later](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/30/lenovo-has-completed-the-2-91-billion-acquisition-of-motorola-from-google/) &mdash; 
 First, Google bought Motorola for $12.5 Billion. Then, three years later, Google sold Motorola to Lenovo for $2.91 Billion. A weird situation, particularly since Motorola is the company behind Google's new [Nexus 6](https://www.google.com/nexus/6/).

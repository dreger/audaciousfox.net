 As I was researching how watches work, I came across Piezoelectricity; the electric charge that materials (Quartz, in the case of watches) will get, in response to applied mechanical stress. Then I thought about how we could use naturally occurring phenomenons, like the ocean tides or wind, in conjunction with the principle of piezoelectricity to create renewable energy, but it appears [many](http://www.mrec.umassd.edu/media/supportingfiles/mrec/agendasandpresentations/1stconference/athiam.pdf) [have](https://www.usc.edu/CSSF/History/2013/Projects/J0218.pdf) [already](http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/39166.pdf) thought of that.

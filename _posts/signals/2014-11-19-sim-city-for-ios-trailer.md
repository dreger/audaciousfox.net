[Sim City for iOS trailer](http://appadvice.com/appnn/2014/11/electronic-arts-shows-off-simcity-buildit-mobile-building-game-in-new-gameplay-trailer) &mdash; 
 So long as EA doesn't riddle it with in-app purchases, this is something I'm looking forward to. Also, has anyone stopped to think about how we have _trailers_ for mobile games now?

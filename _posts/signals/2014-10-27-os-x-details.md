[OS X details](http://www.subtraction.com/2014/10/21/thoughts-on-yosemites-look-and-feel/) &mdash; 
 Khoi Vinh: OS X Yosemite lacks polish, but it opens up the door for a truly robust UI in the coming years. Changing the system font to Helvetica is skating to where the puck is going to be (Retina), but the Swiss font family doesn't work great on non-Retina screens.

_Editor's note: This week, the Signals are going to follow a MWF publishing schedule, so I have more time to work on longer pieces. Signals are a great way to build the narrative of AF; however, care must be taken to keep a healthy balance between curation of the conversation and contribution to it. With that, here are the things I read that you should too._

[There's a poop joke in here, somewhere](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Development/Omniprocessor-From-Poop-to-Potable) &mdash; Bill Gates demonstrates the Omniprocessor, a project that can take human waste and turn it into clean drinking water. A pilot program is scheduled for later this year, in Dakar, Senegal. The things we can do. 

[Wherein I'm reminded of my love for chess](https://itunes.apple.com/app/deep-green-chess/id299471086?mt=8) &mdash; Deep Green Chess, by Cocoa Stuff, is my favorite chess app for iOS. This week, the long-awaited refreshed UI was released, and it's just great. There are little details everywhere, which help take my mind off of getting demoralized by Deep Green's AI.  

[Dirty car artist](http://www.cultofmac.com/308134/dirty-car-art-scott-wade/) &mdash; The amount of effort that went into these ephemeral creations is a befitting example of passion meets creativity.  

[Rocket scientist](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/) &mdash; Elon Musk, Tesla and SpaceX CEO, recently did a Reddit AMA (ask me anything), where the community could vote up questions for Mr. Musk to answer. My favorites responses include those related to: [computer singularity](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/cnfq7rp), [a great daily habit](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/cnfpv7q), [advice from Churchill](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/cnfsjx3), and [the cost of intellectual context switching](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rgsan/i_am_elon_musk_ceocto_of_a_rocket_company_ama/cnfput4).

[The Five Minute Journal](http://www.fiveminutejournal.com/) &mdash; I don't own this journal, but I love the idea of breaking my daily journaling into two sessions: one in the morning and one right before bed; two sessions help enforce perspective. If, like me, you use [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) or write your entries digitally, you can just copy the prompts from the FMJ and fill them in throughout the day. 

[Piezoelectricity](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Piezoelectricity) &mdash; As I was researching how watches work, I came across Piezoelectricity; the electric charge that materials (Quartz, in the case of watches) will get, in response to applied mechanical stress. Then I thought about how we could use naturally occurring phenomenons, like the ocean tides or wind, in conjunction with the principle of piezoelectricity to create renewable energy, but it appears [many](http://www.mrec.umassd.edu/media/supportingfiles/mrec/agendasandpresentations/1stconference/athiam.pdf) [have](https://www.usc.edu/CSSF/History/2013/Projects/J0218.pdf) [already](http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/39166.pdf) thought of that. 

[When you laugh and why you do](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/12/cracking-the-sitcom-code/384068/?single_page=true) &mdash; Noah Charney, writing for _The Atlantic_, breaks down the to-the-minute formula that all great TV sitcom scripts borrow from. 

[Read the manual](https://www.flickr.com/photos/joeclark/sets/72157647793041923/) &mdash; Joe Clark has put together a Flickr album full of scanned user manuals for dish washing machines. Apparently, most dishwashing machine manuals provide illustrated examples as to how best load your dishwasher, for maximum effectiveness. I'm a sucker for this stuff.

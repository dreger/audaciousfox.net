[Be My Eyes](http://bemyeyes.org/) &mdash; "Lend Your Eyes to the Blind:"

> Be My Eyes is an app that connects blind people with volunteer helpers from around the world via live video chat.

Incredibly cool. Using the app, a blind user can request assistance from a network of volunteers, which can help the user read labels, check expiry dates, or navigate around. So cool. 

[Where blanket statements about workplace environments are contested](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2015/01/open-and-shut/) &mdash; First, the Washington Post wrote that "Google got it wrong. The open-office trend is destroying the workplace." Then, veteran manager, Michael Lopp, [responded](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/your-best-work/), and then, it seemed, everyone who has ever worked in an office weighed in. This piece by Dr. Drang summed things up nicely, and catching the tail end of the discussion gives us a nice chain to walk back up for context. I agree with much of what Dr. Drang wrote, even if I did cringed a bit as the distinction between "real engineers" and software engineers was pointed out; even calling software engineers "special snowflakes." Oddly vitriolic.

[Smile on three](http://thehairpin.com/2015/01/the-truth-about-your-smile/) &mdash; Molly Beauchemin, writing for The Hairpin, with some great advice for taking care of your teeth. (via [Kottke](http://kottke.org/15/01/how-to-take-better-care-of-your-teeth))

[Partners at Teehan+Lax join Facebook ](http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/16/partners-at-teehanlax-the-design-firm-behind-medium-join-facebook/) &mdash; If you're a designer, chances are you know who Teehan+Lax are or you've used their work. Looks like not everyone gets to go to Facebook, which means that a lot of amazing design talent just became available in Toronto. 

[You are what you share](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/01/you-are-what-you-share.html) &mdash; Seth Godin: "It takes guts to say, 'I read this and you should too.'"

[China to launch $6.5B venture fund](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/15/china-venturecapital-idUSL3N0UU04V20150115) &mdash; That's a large sum of money. The fund will target start-ups that focus on technology and green energy. 

[Tony Fadell to take over Google Glass project](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/google-glass-to-leave-research-lab-as-new-boss-takes-over-project/) &mdash; Two things: 1.) Google Glass, in its current form, is failing hard, and 2.) Tony Fadell, "Father of the iPod," is a great choice for this project. But, honestly, I just don't see the appeal of Google Glass. I really don't. I'm open to the idea of augmenting my peripheral view with computers, but $1,500 for crappy battery life and look-at-me aesthetics isn't the way to do it. 

[The Phone Separation Anxiety Challenge ](http://recode.net/2015/01/15/can-you-survive-the-phone-separation-anxiety-challenge/) &mdash; Nellie Bowles, for Re/code, writing about the upcoming WNYC "Bored and Brilliant" project. They've partnered with [Moment](https://inthemoment.io/), an app that tracks the number of times you check your phone, and the event kicks off February 2. 

[On why my kids will have very limited screen time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HbYScltf1c) &mdash; NSFW language, but this interview with Louis C.K. is one of my favorite social commentaries on cell phones and kids. 

[I have a Google Alert set up for "loren brichter"](http://www.objc.io/issue-20/loren-brichter.html) &mdash; objc.io, a periodical that curates development techniques for iOS and OS X, conducted an interview with Tweetie and Letterpress developer, Loren Brichter. The whole piece is just fascinating, particularly since Mr. Brichter seems to have a melancholy outlook on programming. However, my favorite bit is this part, about phones and kids: 

> **You said earlier that you’ve been spending less time in front of the screen lately. I can imagine that becoming a father has been a major part of this.** &mdash; [Brichter]: Absolutely. I’m going to be crazy strict in terms of limiting screen time, which maybe is ironic given what I’ve done for a living. I’m not sure when it happened, but my perspective on the mobile revolution shifted. It used to be really exciting just to see someone pull out an iPhone. Now it’s like, “Hey kid, stop staring at your phone!” And apps, apps everywhere! Apps for wiping your butt. I’ve become an old fogey. Get your apps off my lawn!

[The logos of the 70's ](https://m.flickr.com/#/photos/mr_carl/sets/72157604144345854/) &mdash; Eric Carl scanned in pages from the World of Logotypes, circa mid-1970's. Word to the wise: make sure you're on Wi-Fi, if you're browsing from a mobile device. 

[A lot, actually](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when) &mdash; "What happens when you type google.com into your browser and press enter?"

[Progress](http://daringfireball.net/2015/01/siri_improvements) &mdash John Gruber did an experiment, comparing the speed of Siri to Google Voice Search. The speed of each service appear to be very comparable, which is a heck of an improvement for Siri.

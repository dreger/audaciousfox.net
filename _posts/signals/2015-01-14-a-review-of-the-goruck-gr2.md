 This GORUCK GR2 review, by Alvaro Serrano, is sublime.  I may just start forwarding my [review of the (similar) GORUCK GR1](http://kyledreger.com/archives/14113-goruck-gr1.html), because Mr. Serrano's version eclipses mine, in all possible ways. After reading through this piece twice, I'm not sure which is better: the photography, the writing style, or the way the Tools and Toys design handles long-form content.

[Read the manual](https://www.flickr.com/photos/joeclark/sets/72157647793041923/) &mdash; 
 Joe Clark has put together a Flickr album full of scanned user manuals for dish washing machines. Apparently, most dishwashing machine manuals provide illustrated examples as to how best load your dishwasher, for maximum effectiveness. I'm a sucker for this stuff.

_Editor's note: More links than yesterday. Still debating about whether the actual links should be numbers (a la Tab Dump) or text, as seen in this post._

[Don't buy drugs that way](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/daily-report-cvs-and-rite-aid-disable-apple-pay/) &mdash; CVS and Rite Aid: we're partnering with a new mobile payment solution, so we've disabled Apple Pay from our stores nationwide.

["Dare I say, magical"](http://stevensblog.org/apple-pay-rejections/) &mdash; Steven Aquino: Apple Pay is a huge step forward for accessibility at the cash register. People with low vision can just tap their finger to Touch ID and pay; no more fiddling around with credit cards.  

[CrappyC](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/currentc/id912922036?mt=8) &mdash; Meet the "new mobile payment solution" that CVS and Rite Aid disabled Apple Pay for. Early reviews don't look good, but neither does the idea of using QR codes at checkout.

[Get $20 for owning a $700 phone](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/27/wells-fargo-apple-pay-credits/) &mdash; Wells Fargo will pay you $20 to test out Apple Pay.

[Education is a fundamental human right](http://www.apple.com/education/connectED/) &mdash; Apple: We're partnering with ConnectED to give technology grants to 114 schools in 29 states. "A lack of equal access to technology and knowledge puts entire communities and populations of students at a disadvantage, especially minorities. [...] We want to do our part to change this." Nice.

[Delicious kerning](http://discover.typography.com/theme/whats-cooking/font/Surveyor/) &mdash; H&amp;Co: Want to see restaurant menus that don't look terrible?  

[OS X details](http://www.subtraction.com/2014/10/21/thoughts-on-yosemites-look-and-feel/) &mdash; Khoi Vinh: OS X Yosemite lacks polish, but it opens up the door for a truly robust UI in the coming years. Changing the system font to Helvetica is skating to where the puck is going to be (Retina), but the Swiss font family doesn't work great on non-Retina screens.

[Fighting fire with fire](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8647/amazon-announces-the-fire-tv-stick) &mdash; Amazon: Introducing the Fire TV Stick. Prime Subscribers can [get it for $19](http://amzn.com/B00GDQ0RMG) (next two days only); otherwise, it will run $39 when it ships on November 19th. If we didn't already stream through the PS4, I'd pick one of these up.

[Good luck installing iOS 8](https://twitter.com/HistoryInPics/status/519927266621788160) &mdash; In 1956, a 5 _megabyte_ hard disk weighed over 1,000kg.

[Another nail in the flash drive's coffin](https://blog.onedrive.com/office-365-onedrive-unlimited-storage/) â€” Microsoft: If you're subscribed to Office 365 ($6.99/mo), get ready for unlimited OneDrive storage. There's a digital waiting list, but this could be a good deal for students who are already on their university's subscription.  

[5G](http://recode.net/2014/10/27/the-race-to-5g-is-on/) &mdash; Re/Code: Plans for 5G cellular service are already underway. What I find remarkable is twofold: 1.) within a half decade, 10 gigabits per second _cellular_ data will be here; and 2.) we're already referring to the current spectrum as "traditional 4G frequencies."

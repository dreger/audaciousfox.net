Small RSS update: Tapping on the title of a Signals link in the RSS feed will now take you to the linked-to content. No more tapping through to AF, only to have to tap again on the outbound link. I liked readers actually reading on the site, but the implementation was unintuitive and painful &mdash; sorry about that. Should you want to go to the corresponding AF page, I've included a permalink at the bottom of every Signals post. 

Thanks to [Chris Gonzales](http://www.sparkjournal.net/about/) for his email that pushed me to make this change. If anyone else sees something weird in the RSS feed, do [let me know](http://audaciousfox.com/about).

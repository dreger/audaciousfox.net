[Retina iMac, seven days in](http://shawnblanc.net/2014/10/a-week-with-the-retina-imac/) &mdash; 
 Shawn Blanc: "My review of the new Retina iMac could be said as one word: sensational." I'd use a similar word to describe Mr. Blanc's review. I also find it interesting that Mr. Blanc switched from a laptop / external monitor setup to a desktop / iPad one. I'd like to try that, but first I'd like to get that iMac.

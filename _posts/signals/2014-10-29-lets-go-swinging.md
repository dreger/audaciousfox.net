_Editor's note: Less news today, but more variety. Some of the stories that I didn't post were quite boring, but I guess that's Wednesday for you._

[CurrentC has been hacked](http://www.mcx.com/blog/1028-email-incident-report/) &mdash;  Of all the times for this to happen, this week is probably the worst. Looks like it was [just a few email addresses](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/29/retailer-backed-apple-pay-rival-currentc-has-been-hacked-testers-email-addresses-stolen/), but still.

[Google's Project Ara](http://www.wired.com/2014/10/day-with-project-ara) &mdash; A cell phone made up of modular components that you put together like Lego bricks. There's huge potential for this, if they can pull it off.

[iOS 8 hits 52%](https://developer.apple.com/support/appstore/) &mdash; Apple: Yea, this is going to take a while because no one deletes their messages or photos. But just look at iOS 8 _and_ iOS 7, that's 95%!

[Gloomy quarter for Samsung](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/30/us-samsung-elec-results-idUSKBN0II2N120141030) &mdash; Quarterly profit is down 60% this year. They hope seasonal TV sales will help pick things back up. No mention of The Next Big Thing&trade;.

[Apple stock way up](http://time.com/money/3545691/apple-stock-buy-sell/) &mdash; Apple stock has hit an all-time high of $105, or $735 pre-split.

[Microsoft cuts another 3,000 jobs](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/29/microsoft-fires-another-set-of-employees-continuing-its-announced-layoff-strategy/)  &mdash; Only a few hundred remain, of the original 18,000 cuts that were announced in July. Sad times.

[Twitter and IBM bring social data to enterprise. ](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/29/twitter-partners-with-ibm-to-bring-social-data-to-the-enterprise) &mdash; Under the new partnership, IMB gets access to the all of Twitter's tweets, and Twitter gets access to IMB's [Watson](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/). Loads of interesting possibilities here.

[Ferrari to be spun off into separate company, horse logo still looks angry](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/29/us-fiatchrysler-ferrari-divestiture-idUSKBN0II1DB20141029) &mdash;  A sign of the tough economic times for luxury car manufacturers.  

[Explaining calculus, with pics and gifs](http://0a.io/0a-explains-calculus) &mdash; Archy Wilhes: "Understanding calculus is not hard at all. It is just a matter of whether you have stumbled upon the right resources to learn it. If you have difficulty understanding it, you are probably learning it the wrong way." I wish more textbooks were like this post,

[60 frames-per-second YouTube videos](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/29/60-fps-youtube/) &mdash;  I didn't think 60 (vs the previous 30) FPS would make that much of a difference. I was wrong; things look incredibly smooth.

[For your eyes only](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/10/mpaa-movie-theaters-announce-zero-tolerance-policy-against-wearables/) &mdash; David Kravets: "the Motion Picture Association of America updated their anti-piracy policies and said that 'wearable devices' must be powered off at show time." An inevitable move.

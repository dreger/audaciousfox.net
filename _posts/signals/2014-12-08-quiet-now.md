_Editor's note: I've decided to call AF's daily roundup of links "Signals," hinting at the inspiration I took from Coudal Partners' [Fresh Signals](http://coudal.com/) feed. Enjoy!_

[The Trolley problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem): 

> Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options: (1) Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track. (2) Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person. Which is the correct choice?

['My Om Nom' Virtual Pet](http://toucharcade.com/2014/12/08/my-om-nom-virtual-pet-coming-soon/) &mdash; I've always wondered why virtual pets didn't take off like they did in the 90's. Nevertheless, this looks like [Hatch](http://www.hatchpet.com/), but with a character that has better brand recognition. 

[Graph search](http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/08/facebook-keyword-search/) &mdash; Facebook now lets you keyword search for status updates.

[Scholarships for E-Sports](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/09/technology/esports-colleges-breeding-grounds-professional-gaming.html) &mdash; Although calling it E-**Sports** (competitive video games) sounds weird at first, it's not as odd when you consider all sports are grouped under the umbrella of entertainment. 

[Transmit for iOS can no longer "Send to iCloud Drive"](http://www.panic.com/blog/transmit-ios-1-1-1/) &mdash; Apple’s constantly changing policy on what apps can do with iOS 8’s new APIs is disheartening. 

[PYRO Fireshooter](http://www.ellusionist.com/pyro-handheld-fireshooter-by-adam-wilber.html) &mdash; I don't know what's more impressive: for $174, I can shoot fireballs from my hands; or that [the disclaimer](http://www.ellusionist.com/pyro-disclaimer) is 1,400 words long. 

[App Store's “Best of 2014″](http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-posts-best-of-2014-app-store-and-itunes-store-lists/) &mdash; App of the Year: [Elevate](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elevate-brain-training/id875063456?mt=8&uo=4&at=10ltSa); Game of the Year: [Threes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/threes!/id779157948?mt=8&uo=4&at=10ltSa). Very well-deserved. 

[The new DeviantArt](http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_deviantart_by_moving_brands.php) &mdash; I was a regular visitor of DeviantArt's wallpaper selection, back when AIM was still cool. Very nice identity refresh for a new generation. 

[Simply Gum — All-Natural Chewing Gum](http://toolsandtoys.net/simply-gum-all-natural-chewing-gum/) &mdash; Haven't tried the gum, but this is great packaging. What's coffee-flavored gum taste like? 

[The best books Bill Gates read this year](http://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2014) &mdash; I've been meaning to read _Business Adventures_ for a while now; perhaps once I finish [_Casino Royal_](https://twitter.com/kyledreger/status/541785979204689920).

[What's the smallest positive integer that gives no Google hits?](http://godplaysdice.blogspot.com/2008/09/first-number-not-in-google.html) &mdash; Somewhere between 52 and 77 million, there exists a number that, when Googled, returns no results. However, should we ever find it, Google will probably index the webpage containing the article. 

[NASA's sweet setup](https://www.flickr.com/photos/andyi/15345308884/) &mdash; The NASA Goddard space weather lab looks awesome. (via Andy Ihnatko)

[Austin Mann's Gift Guide for iPhone Photographers](http://austinmann.com/trek/iphone-photographer-gadgets) &mdash; Nice list of gifts for mobile photographers, and I especially like this little bit: "Many of these tools are a lot of fun and I find them each useful in their own way, but remember: your tools and gear don’t create images... only you do."

[Obvious Ventures, looking for “world-positive” startups](http://recode.net/2014/12/08/ev-williams-obvious-ventures-looks-to-combine-profit-and-purpose/) &mdash; Inspiring, from founder Ev Williams: 

> “The opportunity we see is that [Obvious portfolio companies] can create win-wins,” said Williams. “They’re not going to get mainstream attention because they do good, but because they are good. I think Tesla’s an example of this. It’s just a badass car. It’s extra-awesome that it’s electric. We’re at a time when that is possible across many different sectors.”

[What's next?](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/12/whats-next.html) &mdash; Solid questions from Seth Godin. "What are you measuring?"

[Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer cut from classic footage](http://boingboing.net/2014/12/08/star-wars-the-force-awakens-t.html) &mdash; I'm loving this long tail of nostalgia and the creativity it seems to have create within fans. 

[Windows text-editor: Write!](http://wri.tt/) &mdash; Clean and crisp design. Also, a Windows text-editor that uses a "Custom rendering engine" for fonts, ensuring they look great? Thumbs up.

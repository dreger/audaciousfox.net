 This article made some waves in my circles, but I'm almost a little disappointed that it did. To me, the popularity this piece means one of two things: 1.) either it's rare for teenagers to be vocal about their opinions on web products, or 2.) we, the builders of said products, aren't actually talking to our users. #1 is unlikely, whereas #2 is somewhat disheartening.

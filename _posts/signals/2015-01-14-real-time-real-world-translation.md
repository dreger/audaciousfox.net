 The new Google Translate app can use your camera to perform real time translation on signs, maps, and more. Really cool, and great for impressing your Spanish teacher, but it should be noted that [Word Lens](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/word-lens/id383463868?mt=8) was doing this [back in 2010](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2010/dec/20/word-lens-app-translates), and this was on the iPhone 4.

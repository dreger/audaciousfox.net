[&apos;My Om Nom&apos; Virtual Pet](http://toucharcade.com/2014/12/08/my-om-nom-virtual-pet-coming-soon/) &mdash; 
 I've always wondered why virtual pets didn't take off like they did in the 90's. Nevertheless, this looks like [Hatch](http://www.hatchpet.com/), but with a character that has better brand recognition.

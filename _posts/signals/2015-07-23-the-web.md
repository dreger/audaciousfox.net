"We live in a world now where not millions but billions of people work in rice fields, textile factories, where children grow up in appalling poverty. Of those billions, how many are the greatest minds of our time? How many deserve better than they get? What if instead of dreaming about changing the world with tomorrow's technology, we used today's technology and let the world change us? Why do we need to obsess on artificial intelligence, when we're wasting so much natural intelligence?" Taken from Maciej Ceg≈Çowski's [speech at the HOW Interactive Design conference](http://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm).

[Amazon Fire Stick Review](http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/21/fire-tv-stick-review-a-great-streamer-for-an-amazon-household/) &mdash; 
 Matt Burns: "Thereâ€™s a bit of lag and hesitation while navigating items on the Fire TV stick. The navigation is smooth enough, but not silky smooth like on the full fledged Fire TV." Drat; inputs that lag rank near the top of my list of tech-related loathings. I'll wait to see a video review, but this is still disheartening.

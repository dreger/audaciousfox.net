[&quot;The Importance of Looking a Little Funny&quot;](http://www.acontinuouslean.com/2014/11/11/importance-funny/) &mdash; 
 Jake Gallagher: "French director/actor Jacques Tatiâ€™s biography states that he was born in 1907 and died in 1982, but the truth is Tati was a man immune to time." Lots of pictures, and a fun read.

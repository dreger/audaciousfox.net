Paul Ford, writing about the green and blue bubbles that appear when iOS users send SMS and iMessages respectively: 

> The bubbles are a subtle, little, silly thing but they are experienced by millions of people. That amplifies that product decision into a unsubtle, large, sort-of-serious thing. The people who are tweeting negatively about green bubbles are following Apple’s lead. It’s speculative, but not totally speculative to say that Apple may be aware it’s leading this way—after all, Apple [has done passive-aggressive product design before](http://dashes.com/anil/2007/10/smug-ugly.html), like giving Windows machines on its network a “Blue Screen of Death” icon.

I remember when my mother-in-law and sister-in-law finally got iMessage; we had a little emoji party to celebrate their new blue-bubble status. It was silly, and we weren't being serious, but there may have been actual subconscious truth to that emotion after all.

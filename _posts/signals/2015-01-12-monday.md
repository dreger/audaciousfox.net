_Editor's note: If you're reading this via RSS, I'd encourage you to come check out the site in person. i've tweaked the color palettes of the day / night themes, and these Signals now have their own dedicated page. Another post about all these changes, along with a 2015 "outlook" are in the oven and almost done; I'm just waiting to broil the other side of my commas and sprinkle on some quotations marks._

[Je Suis Charlie](http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/bigpicture/2015/01/12/unity-rallies-for-france-terror-victims/YyFyYsLlVoe4G8B2B4wbRP/story.html) &mdash; Today, about 3 million people marched in Paris to honor the victims of the terrorist attack on French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, last Thursday. A little less than a week later, our prayers and thoughts remain with the victims' families and, indeed, France itself. 

[When the Big Apple looks small](https://www.storehouse.co/stories/r3rcy-gotham-7-5k) &mdash; From 7,500 thousand feet in the air, Vincent Laforet captures New York City. Stunning. 

[Field Notes in CSS](http://shelf.bmjt.co.uk/) &mdash; Some of my other other favorite CSS wizardry: [The Avengers](http://codepen.io/mariosmaselli/full/ghmwq/), [The Simpsons](https://pattle.github.io/simpsons-in-css/), and [iOS Devices](http://marvelapp.github.io/devices.css/). (via [JG](http://thenewsprint.co))

[Buzzwords](http://boingboing.net/2015/01/12/30-shockingly-amazing-linkbait.html) &mdash; [Max Woolf](http://minimaxir.com/), mapped out  the top 30 phrases that BuzzFeed uses to get clicks. The most-clicked phrase? Those quizzes that would identify which "character are you." 

[A teenager on social media](https://medium.com/backchannel/a-teenagers-view-on-social-media-1df945c09ac6) &mdash; This article made some waves in my circles, but I'm almost a little disappointed that it did. To me, the popularity this piece means one of two things: 1.) either it's rare for teenagers to be vocal about their opinions on web products, or 2.) we, the builders of said products, aren't actually talking to our users. #1 is unlikely, whereas #2 is somewhat disheartening.  

[Perpetual Neglect](http://shawnblanc.net/2015/01/perpetual-neglect/) &mdash; Shawn Blanc, on safeguarding your creative time: 

> When you work for yourself, there is an oceanic undercurrent that pulls you into the details of your job. The thousand responsibilities of administration and communication and infrastructure. These are important, to be sure, because without them your business would cease to be. But (at least in my case) these are the support structures at best. The foundation of my business is not the ancillary administration; it is the muse.

[Fire in the Amazon](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/09/us-amazon-fire-idUSKBN0KI1WR20150109) &mdash; One of Amazon's in-progress data centers had a small fire, which was quickly resolved. This isn't so much news; rather, it serves as a pragmatic example that our "cloud" is really just a collection of physical buildings, holding copies of our data. If you don't have a backup system in place, here's a gentle reminder to get moving. 

[Capital One acquires Level Money](http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/12/7523071/capital-one-buys-level-money-an-excellent-spending-tracker) &mdash; As if we needed any more hints that mobile is going to be a huge space for payments and money management. I never got fully invested (ha) in Level, but the UI was pleasant, and it seemed like a great way to introduce the [concept of budgeting](http://audaciousfox.com/2014/12/12/budgeting.html) to users.    

[Twilight Struggle](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/designing-the-best-board-game-on-the-planet/) &mdash; This game I've never heard of, [Twilight Struggle](http://amzn.com/B0060L6EE4), is the top-ranked board game in the world. The accompanying article is intriguing, but my real fascination lies in the realization that what I've long considered "board games" (Monopoly, Checkers, etc.) are just the very tip of an an massive, albeit somewhat hidden, gaming culture.

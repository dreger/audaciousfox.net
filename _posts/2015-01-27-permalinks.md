I've spent an inordinate amount of time obsessing over what the "best" permalink style is for various types of blogs. 

- `2015/01/27/title`
- `2015/01/title`
- `2015/title`

Then, there's the brave, who don't mind having their site's root folder chocked full: 

- `/title`

But if you do decide to categorize, do you use category names or overarching post-y names? 

- `/posts/title`
- `/archives/title`
- `/sports/title`
- `/technology/title`

But wait

_Editor's note: Hope you all are staying warm; temperatures have reached the holy-heck-it's-cold range here. Another night without audio, so I think I'll set expectations the same way your schools did for snow days: if it comes, it comes. Stay warm out there, and guys: now's a great time to learn how to properly [tie a scarf](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/02/23/mans-guide-scarf/)._

[A new Billboard](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6320099/billboard-200-makeover-streams-digital-tracks) &mdash; Billboard, the company that tracks the popularity of songs and albums across the country, plans to start including on-demand streaming and digital track sales in the algorithm used to generate Billboard's top music charts.

[President Obama's immigration order ](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/11/20/obamas-immigration-order-will-give-tech-community-some-but-not-all-of-what-it-wants/) &mdash; As part of a plan to keep talent in the United States, Mr. Obama unveiled new immigration plans, which includes allowing foreign-born students remain in the U.S. for an longer period of time than currently allowed. 

[Population.io](http://population.io/) &mdash; Fascinating website that shows where you sit in our global population. 

[Around we go again](https://blog.carousel.com/2014/11/introducing-carousel-for-web-ipad-and-android-tablet/) &mdash; Dropbox has updated their photo backup service, Carousel, with a new web interface and tablet apps. I tried Carousel for a while, but it tries too hard to be clever with photo sharing and gestures on iOS. The standard Dropbox app has the same features and is much more straightforward.

[GoDaddy seeks $4.5 billion valuation](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/20/us-godaddy-ipo-idUSKCN0J41YG20141120) &mdash; I stand by my opinion on GoDaddy, from [back in March](http://kyledreger.com/archives/14073-godaddy-ipo.html): 

> As a web designer and developer, one of the worst decisions you can make is to buy anything from GoDaddy. In my years of buying domains, hosting, and servers, GoDaddy remains the most terrible company I’ve ever had to deal with.

[Contributor](https://gigaom.com/2014/11/20/google-launches-contributor-a-crowdfunding-tool-for-publishers/) &mdash; A new invite-only, advertisement alternative program from Google that lets you pledge money towards your favorite sites on the internet. Cool feature: any sites you pledge towards won't show  ads. 

[Apple's App of the Week: Things](http://www.cultofmac.com/303759/award-winning-task-manager-things-free-week/) &mdash; Things is one of the most polished task managers out there, and it's currently available for free as Apple's App of the Week. Even if you already have your way of Getting Things Done&trade;, check Things out; it's fantastic iOS design. 

["Let’s see that again in an instant replay"](http://pxlnv.com/blog/thoughts-on-watchkit/) &mdash; Astute dissection of the WatchKit SDK and San Francisco typeface, by Nick Heer. Particularly how the Apple Watch requires all animates to be _prerendered_ and not done dynamically. 

[Re/code closes down comments](http://recode.net/2014/11/20/a-note-to-recode-readers/) &mdash; For a majority (and when I say "majority," I'd argue > 90%) of websites out there, internet comments are a stew of vitriolic language and low quality logic. If you really have something to say, 1.) write an email to the author, or 2.) write your own blog post. 

[Website lists thousands of lives feeds to baby monitors, webcams](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30121159) &mdash; If you use a baby monitor or standalone webcam (not the one in your laptop) that connects to the internet, make sure you change the default password or disable the live streaming settings. Scary stuff. 

[What Life in Space Is Really Like ](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/marsha-ivins/) &mdash; Lovely article by _Wired's_ Caitlin Roper, as told by astronaut Caitlin Roper: 

> There’s no way to anticipate the emotional impact of leaving your home planet. You look down at Earth and realize: You’re not on it. It’s breathtaking. It’s surreal. It’s a “we’re not in Kansas anymore, Toto” kind of feeling. But I’ve spent a total of 55 days in space, over the course of five missions for NASA, and I’ve learned that being out there isn’t just a series of breathtaking moments. It’s a mix of the transcendently magical and the deeply prosaic. It can be crowded, noisy, and occasionally uncomfortable. Space travel—at least the way we do it today—isn’t glamorous. But you can’t beat the view!

[High Tech Notebooks](http://recode.net/2014/11/20/moleskine-partners-with-adobe-in-latest-bid-to-make-paper-notebooks-high-tech/) &mdash; Moleskine has partnered with Adobe to bring some neat paper-to-digital technology to the note taking process. However, this is where I find myself leaning evermore towards Field Notes; where a notebook is never anything more or less. 

[Field Notes: Ambition](http://www.thenewsprint.co/2014/11/20/field-notes-ambition-2/) &mdash; The Newsprint reviews the latest Field Notes edition: Ambition. I wasn't going to get any more notebooks this year, but I'm in love with the Ambition edition's gilded pages. 

[Tilda](http://tilda.fontbureau.com/) &mdash; Wonderful new typeface out by Jessica Hische. If it looks familiar, that's because it was designed and used for the title lettering in Wes Anderson's _Moonrise Kingdom_.

[Wherein you first meet the Thom Browne Suit](http://www.acontinuouslean.com/2014/11/20/thom-browne-suit-die/) &mdash; Because I'm a sucker for history on the art of looking good, or, as is sometimes the case, _trying_ to look good.

title: And Then All Was Quiet and Still, for It Was Time to Sleep

_Editor's note: this issue of AF is getting out late because [none of my raffle tickets were winners](https://twitter.com/kyledreger/status/535995346359685120). Nonetheless, the show goes on. As we round the last weekend before American Thanksgiving, I wish you all a lovely weekend, and I'll keep you updated regarding the upcoming holiday publishing schedule. Enjoy._

[The Secret Life of Passwords](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/magazine/the-secret-life-of-passwords.html) &mdash; Ian Urbina, for _The New York Times_, wrote the perfect read for your Saturday morning coffee. Apologies if you've already seen this pull quote, but it's just so damn good:  

> Several years ago I began asking my friends and family to tell me their passwords. I had come to believe that these tiny personalized codes get a bum rap. Yes, I understand why passwords are universally despised: the strains they put on our memory, the endless demand to update them, their sheer number. I hate them, too. But there is more to passwords than their annoyance. In our authorship of them, in the fact that we construct them so that we (and only we) will remember them, they take on secret lives. Many of our passwords are suffused with pathos, mischief, sometimes even poetry. Often they have rich back stories. A motivational mantra, a swipe at the boss, a hidden shrine to a lost love, an inside joke with ourselves, a defining emotional scar — these keepsake passwords, as I came to call them, are like tchotchkes of our inner lives. They derive from anything: Scripture, horoscopes, nicknames, lyrics, book passages. Like a tattoo on a private part of the body, they tend to be intimate, compact and expressive.

[Saying no](http://boz.com/articles/say-no.html) &mdash; Being protective of your time is one of the best ways to keep productive. 

[TL;DR Bible](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/2mpv2r/the_stories_of_the_bible_in_tldr_form/) &mdash; This abridged version of the Bible provides some good laughs and a touch of blunt honesty. 

[Amazon Fire Stick Review](http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/21/fire-tv-stick-review-a-great-streamer-for-an-amazon-household/) &mdash; Matt Burns: "There’s a bit of lag and hesitation while navigating items on the Fire TV stick. The navigation is smooth enough, but not silky smooth like on the full fledged Fire TV." Drat; inputs that lag rank near the top of my list of tech-related loathings. I'll wait to see a video review, but this is still disheartening. 

[A smaller, more powerful leaf blower engine ](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/tiny-engine-make-leaf-blowers-sound-less-like-jet-engines/) &mdash; It's amazing how we continue to make non-electronic things smaller and more powerful. Plus, the entire premise of a combustion engine is just cool: hundred of tiny, controlled explosions are the (literal) driving force that help you clean off your sidewalk. 

[Strangled by cable](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/21/us-aereo-bankruptcy-idUSKCN0J513K20141121) &mdash; Aereo, the company that offered on-demand DVR video, has applied for bankruptcy, after being sued by the cable companies. It was a clever attempt to circumvent the monopolized and bundled nature of TV, but there was no way they were going to last in the current environment. 

[Apple's E-Book settlement finalized](http://recode.net/2014/11/21/apple-450-million-e-book-settlement-gets-final-court-approval/) &mdash; U.S. District Judge Denise Cote has approved Apple's agreement to pay $450 Million for "conspiring with five publishers to raise e-book prices."

[Google Inc., Gmail Inc., Google Drive Inc., Etc.](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/21/in-europe-a-resolution-to-break-up-google/) &mdash; The European Parliament have called for a resolution that asks Google to unbundle search from the rest of its portfolio of products. This reminds me of 2003, when the European Union ordered Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without Windows Media Player installed; however, I'd argue that the web is far less prone to lock in than operating systems are. 

[Tracking deliveries on iOS](http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/favorite-deliveries-tracker/) &mdash; The Sweet Setup picks Deliveries as their favorite delivery tracker. Push notifications and the Notification Center widget should come in handy during this holiday season. Check it out. 

_Have a great weekend, all. If you get bored this weekend, I'd love to hear from you by tweet, [@kyledreger](http://twitter.com/kyledreger), or email. Stay warm, and stay classy &mdash; see you next week._

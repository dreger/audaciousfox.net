_Editor's note: Another Monday, another edition of AF. Not much on docket this evening, as I'm trying to be ruthless in what I cut from my list of "maybe publishables" that grows throughout the day._

[Against Productivity](https://medium.com/message/against-productivity-b19f56b67da6) &mdash; This essay took four years for Ms. Norton to write, and you need to take twenty minutes to sit down and read it. I may not agree with all her conclusions, but this is the type of discourse that keeps our creativity alive. 

[Apple's Visa](http://store.apple.com/us/browse/finance/instant_credit) &mdash; Interesting that this exists, considering Apple Pay. Wouldn't mind my Visa purchases adding up towards free apps, though. 

[Eurogamer.net Review of Pro Evolution Soccer 2015: 9/10](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-11-10-pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review) &mdash; If you enjoy playing digital soccer, you owe it to yourself to go download a demo of Pro Evolution Soccer. Video games rarely propel me out of my seat, but that's exactly what happened as I had Messi strike a beautiful over-the-shoulder volley into the back of Real Madrid's net.  

[xkcd: Efficiency](http://xkcd.com/1445/) &mdash; The paradox with most to-do apps is that I oft spend more time toying with them than actually getting work done. 

[The deception of vitality](https://twitter.com/agiletortoise/status/530160947906629632) &mdash; After selling just 6 units in the US App Store, Greg Pierce's app (Phraseology) jumped into the top 100 Productivity apps.  

[Office hours](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/technology/microsoft-to-give-away-mobile-version-of-office-software.html) &mdash; The season of consumers demanding free software is officially upon us: all Office apps are now free on iOS. As of this writing, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint are #1, #2, and #3 on the Top Free Chart respectively. 

[President Obama's statement on net neutrality](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/11/10/obama-to-the-fcc-adopt-the-strongest-possible-rules-on-net-neutrality-including-title-ii/) &mdash; Mr. Obama urged the FCC and chairman, Tom Wheeler, to reclassify the internet as a utility. A win for supporters of net neutrality, but ultimately could do little to sway the independently-run FCC. 

[Deregister and Turn Off iMessage](https://selfsolve.apple.com/deregister-imessage) &mdash; Apple now provides a way to get your phone number out of "[iMessage purgatory](http://adampash.com/imessage-purgatory/)." 

[Instagram 6.2 update](http://blog.instagram.com/post/102294612077/discovery-and-caption-editing) &mdash; Several new icons for elements in the app; no new icon _for_ the app.     

[Outdoor Voices athletic gear](http://outdoorvoices.com/collections/shop-man) &mdash; Neat concept, athletic gear for those not conservatively "athletic," but if you're trying to market to a group that doesn't want to look like a Nike athlete, $120 for sweatpants is the wrong way to run.

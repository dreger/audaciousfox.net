title: "1,000 Words on No Man's Sky"
---

One of my favorite speeches is one that was never given. In 1969, the world followed Apollo 11 as it ascended into our atmosphere and transcended our perceived notions of American achievement.

Despite the final success of that mission, President Nixon was not aloof to the potential for tragedy.  In a speech titled, “In the Event of a Moon Disaster,” Nixon's speechwriter Bill Safire penned the following lines:

> In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.

> Others will follow and surely find their way home. Man's search will not be denied. But these men were the first, and they will remain the foremost in our hearts.

> For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind.

Which brings me to Hello Games most recent video game, No Man’s Sky.

My screen faded to black as my spaceship dissolved before my eyes. I had been shot down by two unnamed vessels, in what I felt was the most unfair fight in the galaxy. As I respawned aboard yet another nondescript space station, identical to the previous five, I checked my ship’s inventory to confirm, without surprise, that it had been emptied. Seriously. Fuck those guys.

There are no boxes into which one can put No Man’s Sky (NMS). Part Minecraft, part Don’t Starve, part Botanist Adventure for Kids™, NMS sits at the center of the world’s most elaborate van diagram. Or spirograph. It’s fun, and frustrating, in ways that I’ve never really experienced before.

## Title Sequence

The title sequence, or poster image that displays game during launch on the PS4, is just the title NO MAN’S SKY in black against a white background. However, what I love about this title is the capital S letterform, where they’ve intentionally cut the bottom tail of the spine shorter than the top. Typically, when creating a typeface, the designer will attempt to instill a sense of symmetry, of balance. But with this S, should it be rendered into a physical form, would most surly fall over. To that end, what I find most fascinating is how I think this letter represents a large part of the NMS experience: unique and physics defying.

Once you get past the launch poster, you’re flown through an expanse of stars, some of which include a label that indicates a star’s name. There’s no way we know whether that’s actually the name of a star in the game, and odds are you’ll never be able to find out. You’re simply asked to trust them.

Trust, more than anything, is the cornerstone of NMS.

Whatever preconceived notions you have regarding pace of play, you need to forget them immediately. After 15 minutes of NMS, the most common complaint will undoubtedly be the severe case of whiplash that occurs when you play a game that gives a damn about time and speed. You move as fast as you would if you were there. You fly as fast as you could if you were there. Everything is to scale. There are no shortcuts. Get comfy, because you’re going to be here a while.

## Survive

Arguably the most undersold feature of NMS is the element of survival. Leaning how to keep your gear and ship maintained is critical to any form of success? Can we even call it success? You survive because you have to survive. There are no bonuses, better gear, or awards, other than you getting to continue on living. Survival, in this way, feels alien. Alien because survival games rarely make the survival process feel as nonchalant and deadly as NMS does.

Even though keeping yourself alive requires somewhat constant maintenance and monitoring (although this is lessened by what can only be the most annoying and overprotective personal notification system ever designed), it feels natural once you’ve been in the universe a while.  

## Alone

Lost in the depths of space, you move about the universe and planets at a snail’s pace. Planets, although numbering in the billions, begin to feel a little bit the same after a while. You’ll be confused, but space is confusing. You will spend hours in one system, attempting to lean the alien language of the home residents, and the only benefit may be easier trading or small health boosts. Both of which are of moot value once you jettison off into the void again.

I’ve visited a dozen or so planets, and they’ve all been similarly barren and bleak. Not the sort of worlds you want to stick around, and I’m thankful I could leave.

But one planet was beautiful. So large that it was perpetually night, the faded neon colors from the landscape around me was calming. Small particles drifted through the air, and reflected the light coming from two different white moons. I wish I could have stayed there. I wanted to set up a small base, explore, and tend to the nature around me. Naturally, I would leave to explore, but I would also return.

However, this style of play is not meant to be. NMS doesn’t give you much of an incentive to stick around a planet or system once you’ve landed and surveyed a few outposts. You’re perpetually a visitor, never a resident. Look, touch, then leave. For a game with the sense of scale and depth that NMS gives off, planetary exploration can at times feel incredibly shallow.

## Believe

Of all the things NMS allows you to do, the most compelling is it creates an environment in which you both suspend and become grounded in your beliefs about the universe and how it should work. Given the size of the sandbox we’re allowed to play in, there’s no earthly way we could ever touch every corner. At the same time, while you’re starstruck looking into the void of a billion stars, you’re also acutely focused on collecting and crafting the smallest of elements.

Relax and tighten. Push and pull. NMS is constantly at odds with itself and what it wants you to focus on. Go collect this element, now travel a few million miles. This cadence of play leaves you in a state of continual low-grade anxiety.

About two hours into your journey with NMS, you’re given access to the galactic map. By gently pulling back on the right stick, your field of view will begin to expand, and galaxy after galaxy will zoom past. Two minutes later, should you continue holding down the right stick, you will still be hurtling through space as an unfathomable amount of planets you will never see fly by. At this point in time, the crux of NMS will hit you: there is no way to complete this game.

NMS is about discovery, and there’s no way to discover everything Hello Games has created. Even if you played for every minute from now until your death, you will, at best, only see (not even visit) 1-3% of all available planets.

NMS is not a game you can win. It was designed without the concept of winning. It was designed simply to be. And that, to many of us, is unnerving.

NMS asks us to trust it, but more than trusting the game, we’re asked to trust ourselves.

In NMS, we’ve finally been given the endless, no rules sandbox we’ve been waiting for. But now that it’s here, do you trust yourself to actually have fun? There are no real objectives, there are no villains to hunt down, and there are no leaderboards. It’s just the universe and you. And yet, despite this banishment to a seemingly unescapable oblivion, I feel a small sense of comfort whenever I pull up the galactic map and see the planets I’ve visited.

A small corner of the universe, now forever mankind.

FINAL, RANDOM THOUGHTS

I do wish that NMS had borrowed a few survival elements from Minecraft. When I find a planet that I like, don’t force me to leave. I understand the philosophical goal of this game is to explore, but should that experience be relentless? I think not.

The interface of NMS isn’t great. You adjust to the menus and the convoluted way they have you managing inventory, but it’s still just OK. We also can’t ignore the blatant similarity of NMS’s user interface to the one Bungie designed for Destiny. Destiny’s interface, however, is a joy to use. Free-stick menu navigation is a fine paradigm to implement, but Destiny’s buttery smooth panning and slight friction when you move over a button are fantastic. If I’ll openly fault NMS for anything, it’s this: the menu system lacks a lot of polish.

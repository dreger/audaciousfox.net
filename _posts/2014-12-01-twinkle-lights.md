_Editor's note: Welcome back, dear readers. I hope the holiday break treated you well. Our Thanksgiving was lovely; filled with plenty of family, lots of great food, and a few quiet evenings. No heavy snow here yet, but I imagine it will be coming soon (Ohio has such odd weather, particularly if you are just outside the reach of Lake Erie). Enjoy the issue, and please bear with me as I get back into the swing of putting these together._

[Star Wars: The Force Awakens Trailer](http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/lucasfilm/starwarstheforceawakens/) &mdash; This is everything I hoped it would be. I dare your heart rate not to jump, when the music hits.  

[Star Wars: Episode VII Trailer - George Lucas' Special Edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v93Jh6JNBng) &mdash; Beautiful, poignant, and brilliant. 

["You just need to care."](http://www.marco.org/2014/11/29/easy-listening) &mdash; Marco Arment, on creating great podcasts (and digital things, for that matter).  

[How to Be Polite](https://medium.com/message/how-to-be-polite-9bf1e69e888c) &mdash; Paul Ford: 

> Politeness buys you time. It leaves doors open. I’ve met so many people whom, if I had trusted my first impressions, I would never have wanted to meet again. And yet — many of them are now great friends.

_Note: I've found much, if not all, of what Mr. Ford writes to be true. Basic manners and etiquette will get you far._

[The Economics of Seinfeld](http://yadayadayadaecon.com/) &mdash; Members from the universities of Montana, Eastern Illinois, and Baker use Seinfeld video clips to explain economic principles and theories. 

["Coming Soon" is more of a cute colloquialism](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/12/01/hackers-gave-sony-pictures-entertainment-a-major-headache-thanksgiving-week/) &mdash; A hack at Sony Pictures has resulted in the videos for "Fury," "Annie," “Mr. Turner,” “Still Alice” and “To Write Love on Her Arms” being put up on file-sharing sites. 

[Girl Scout Cookies Finder](http://www.girlscouts.org/program/gs_cookies/digitalcookie.asp) &mdash; Filed away under the it-can-be-poorly-designed-if-the-user-motivation-is-high-enough category of mobile apps.

[FingerKey: use Touch ID to unlock your Mac](http://www.cultofmac.com/304657/app-lets-unlock-mac-touch-id/) &mdash; Neat, but I don't see this being very useful. Reminds me a bit of [Knock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyX8FfSKg04), which did some similar iPhone-unlocks-your-Mac trickery. These are fun apps to show off to friends but ultimately a bit pointless. 

[Featured in the App Store](http://aplus.rs/2014/effect-of-app-store-only-feature-on-ranking-and-downloads/) &mdash; Aleksandar Vacić shows us the numbers that go with getting featured by Apple in the App Store. Interesting that it doesn't take more than a few thousand downloads to break into a category Top 10. 

_Being Apple's [App of the Week](https://twitter.com/ccMick/status/539561334640480256) on the other hand..._

[Mighty Mouse](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26639-the-smart-mouse-with-the-halfhuman-brain.html?cmpid=RSS%7CNSNS%7C2012-GLOBAL%7Conline-news#.VHxnUdYVdlI) &mdash; [Steve Goldman](http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/23788282-steven-a-goldman), Chief of the Department's Division of Cell and Gene Therapy at the University of Rochester Medical Center, and his team have put human brain cells into mice. Those mice that received the cells then performed better in several cognitive tests than the control group. The things we can do. 

[What It Takes to Build a Website](http://24ways.org/2014/what-it-takes-to-build-a-website/) &mdash; Drew McLellan has written up a digital cornucopia of great advice for web designs and developers. A fantastic resource. 

[Atelier Playing Cards](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/padbury/atelier-playing-cards) &mdash; As I was shopping around the internet for holiday gifts, I came across these beautiful playing cards by Robert Padbury. I mean, just look at them. Unfortunately, they're not currently for sale, but you can jump on [waiting list](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/padbury/atelier-playing-cards/posts/959844), if you're interested. 

[YOU can prevent child abuse](http://imgur.com/a/m8ovp) &mdash; Amazing how powerful a shadow can be. Reminds me of a [similar endeavor](http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/child-abuse-ad-uses-lenticular-printing-send-kids-secret-message-adults-cant-see-149197) last year, by the ANAR Foundation. 

[$ or Digits](http://thenuschool.com/can-steal-restaurants-best-pricing-techniques/) &mdash; A look at the psychological effects of including dollar signs ($) on menu prices, based on [this Cornell study](https://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/chr/pubs/reports/abstract-15048.html). Apparently, after we see a dollar sign,  "our brain activates a defense mechanism that wants us to keep our money, and thinks about how to get around this expenditure."

[Are locksmiths who work more slowly perceived as more skilled?](http://danariely.com/2010/12/15/locksmiths/) &mdash; "What this reveals is that consumers don’t value goods and services solely by their utility, benefit from the service, but also a sense of fairness relating to how much effort was exerted." Interesting hypothesis. Thoughts?

[Firefox! 34 Released](http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/01/firefox-34-launches-with-yahoo-as-its-default-search-engine/?ncid=rss) &mdash; That was quick. Firefox now ships with Yahoo search as default. 

[Chinese Mobile App UI Trends](http://dangrover.com/blog/2014/12/01/chinese-mobile-app-ui-trends.html) &mdash; Dan Grover details the different paradigms and conventions that China users are familiar with. The big surprise for me? China _loves_ QR codes. That doesn't make sense, until you see Mr. Grover show how convoluted digital input for Chinese characters can be; QR codes are much easier. 

[unbury.me](http://unbury.me/) &mdash; Have (student) loans? This is a fun, albeit very brightly colored, little site that will show you the breakdown of principle, interest, and dates related to paying off your debt.

_Editor's note: No audio tonight, since my first-year-teacher wife is trying to grab a little extra sleep before the early morning. She works hard, and I'm happy to oblige. Site news &mdash; I've pushed a few small design tweaks to AF, including some typographic changes. Kind of. If you happen to have Apple's lovely new San Francisco Text typeface installed, like I do, you'll be in for a pleasant surprise._

_I counted all my Field Notes notebooks today, and I own 18; four of which are filled. I'm saving my [Pitch Black](http://fieldnotesbrand.com/shop/pitchblack/) ones for the next time I wear a tux._

[Sim City for iOS trailer](http://appadvice.com/appnn/2014/11/electronic-arts-shows-off-simcity-buildit-mobile-building-game-in-new-gameplay-trailer) &mdash; So long as EA doesn't riddle it with in-app purchases, this is something I'm looking forward to. Also, has anyone stopped to think about how we have _trailers_ for mobile games now? 

[Charging iMessage with murder](http://9to5mac.com/2014/11/19/doj-apple-will-lead-to-death-of-child/) &mdash; The _Wall Street Journal_ reports that the Department of Justice told Apple that "the company [Apple] could eventually be directly responsible for the death of a child," because iMessage encryption would prevent law enforcement from reading messages on a suspects phone. 

[When algorithms ruin lives](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/algorithms-great-can-also-ruin-lives/) &mdash; When an algorithm incorrectly flags your driver license for that of a criminal's, the way back can be long and difficult. Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert, argues: 

>  "Weâ€™d be far better off putting people in charge of investigating potential plots and letting them direct the computers, instead of putting the computers in charge and letting them decide who should be investigated." 

[$18 Billion valuation and still playing dirty](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/11/19/ubers-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day/) &mdash; Uber's moral compass is less a compass and more a clock face. 

[The latest Gillette marketing ad](http://imgur.com/1eiimPd) &mdash; As user ZeeLBee points out, "Ooooooh, RAZOR BURN." (via [Coudal](http://coudal.com/archives/2014/11/keep_it_simple.php))

[Building websites through Artificial Intelligence](https://thegrid.io) &mdash; The Grid is a website that builds itself, based on the media outlets you give it. I'm not sold on this idea. The sterile nature of the personality is off-putting for two groups: the techies who could roll their own website, and the artists who want more creative license. 

[Wildcard iOS app](http://coudal.com/archives/2014/11/wildcard.php) &mdash; It's a web browser, based on the "interaction paradigm of cards." Really cool interactions and ideas here; I'd expect no less from Khoi Vinh. 

[Tools and Toys review of the Rain Design mStand](http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/the-rain-design-mstand/) &mdash; This stand is amazing. I'm even considering buying a second, so that I can have one at work and home.

[AnandTech reviews the OnePlus One](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8242/the-oneplus-one-review) &mdash; If I were switching to Android, the OnePlus One is the only phone I would consider getting. My buddy has one, and the build is just great; I think it feels better in the hand than the iPhone 6 does. 

[Bill Cosby rape accusations](http://kottke.org/14/11/bill-cosby-rape-accusations-grow) &mdash; I join the many confused and sad enjoyers of his comedy work. 

[Monument Valley free on Amazon App Store](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KA7JIII/) &mdash; A great game, if you want to pick it up for free. 

["Free" is now "Get"](http://toucharcade.com/2014/11/19/apple-changes-free-to-get-on-app-store-download-buttons/) &mdash; Download buttons for free apps on the App Store now show "Get," instead of "Free." This might just be an experiment, but for free-with-in-app-purchase apps, I think "Get" is a more honest connotation of what the app could _actually_ cost you. 

[NSA reform falls in Congress](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/us/nsa-phone-records.html) &mdash; The legislation would have limited the U.S. government's ability to collect Americans' information. It failed 58 to 42. 

[You Are The Business](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-business/) &mdash; Know your worth. Sage advice for anyone who's going into, or is already in, the tech / business world. (via [JG](http://www.thenewsprint.co/2014/11/19/you-are-the-business/))

[Ben Brooks: The UnderFit Shirt](https://brooksreview.net/2014/11/underfit-update/) &mdash; Any shirt that evokes a 400+ word article because the manufacturer updated the design is worth checking out. _Note: my current favorite tee is the [Mossimo crew neck](http://www.target.com/p/mossimo-supply-co-men-s-crew-neck-t-shirt/-/A-13771083), from Target._

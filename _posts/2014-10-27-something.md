_Editor's note: Should I include an Editor's note with these issues? Part of me likes to set the context, but I also feel that my inline comments do a nice job._

[Don't buy drugs that way](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/27/daily-report-cvs-and-rite-aid-disable-apple-pay/) &mdash; CVS and Rite Aid: we're partners in a new mobile payment solution, so we're going to disabled Apple Pay from our stores nationwide. 

["Dare I say, magical"](http://stevensblog.org/apple-pay-rejections/) &mdash; Steven Aquino: Apple Pay is a huge step forward for accessibility at the cash register. People with low vision can just tap their finger to Touch ID and pay; no more fiddling around with credit cards.  

[CrappyC](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/currentc/id912922036?mt=8) &mdash; Meet the "new mobile payment solution" that CVS and Rite Aid disabled Apple Pay for. Early reviews don't look good, but neither did the idea of using QR codes at checkout. 

[Get $20 for previously having $200](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/10/27/wells-fargo-apple-pay-credits/) &mdash; Wells Fargo will pay you $20 to test out Apple Pay. 

[$150+ Billion in the bank](http://www.apple.com/education/connectED/) &mdash; Apple: We're partnering with ConnectED to give technology grants to 114 schools in 29 states. Students get iPads, teachers get Macbooks. "92% of students from our partner schools are of Hispanic, Black, Native American, Alaskan Native, or Asian heritage." Nice.

[Delicious kerning](http://discover.typography.com/theme/whats-cooking/font/Surveyor/) &mdash; H&amp;Co: Typography is about how different letterforms can complement one another, and a menu is a great place to demonstrate that. 

[Fighting fire with fire](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8647/amazon-announces-the-fire-tv-stick) &mdash; Amazon: The Fire phone flopped, but this little video-streaming stick is actually pretty cool. Prime Subscribers can [get it for $19](http://amzn.com/B00GDQ0RMG) (next two days only); otherwise, it will run $39 when it ships on November 19th. If we didn't already stream through the PS4, I'd pick one of these up. 

[iOS 8 couldn't fit here either](https://twitter.com/HistoryInPics/status/519927266621788160) &mdash; In 1956, a 5 _megabyte_ hard disk weighed over 1,000kg. 

[OS X details](http://www.subtraction.com/2014/10/21/thoughts-on-yosemites-look-and-feel/) &mdash; Khoi Vinh: OS X Yosemite lacks polish, but it opens up the door for a truly robust UI in the coming years. Changing the system typeface to Helvetica is skating to where the puck is going to be (Retina), but, for non-Retina screens, things are a little blurry in the meantime. 

[5G](http://recode.net/2014/10/27/the-race-to-5g-is-on/) &mdash;  The technology behind 5G is interesting, and it offers some incredible speed increases over 4G. But my favorite part is that Ms. Rosenworcel calls the current standard "traditional 4G frequencies." OK. 

[India](http://www.cultofmac.com/301053/iphone-6-sells-just-72-hours-india/) India is still maturing in the high-end smartphone market, but they nonetheless bought all 55k iPhone 6 units within 72 hours of launch. 

[All your things](http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/10/27/microsoft-starts-expanding-unlimited-cloud-storage-new-existing-office-365-subscribers/) â€” thi

[Chin](http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/10/27/desperate-measures-as-world-leaders-visit-beijing-tries-to-reduce-pollution-by-40/) &mdash; In an effor to reduce up to 40% polution, China alternate-driving days for cars with even- and odd-numbered license plates. 

[Apple Watch UI](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/27/this-is-what-the-apple-watch-interface-looks-like-on-an-iphone/?ncid=rss): Interesting, but some big UX flaws. Touching somewhere that's "not" an icon would be difficult, and there aren't any good spacial indicators.

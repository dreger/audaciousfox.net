_Editor's note: If any of you were wondering, the AF workflow makes heavy use of the following: [Unread](http://supertop.co/unread/), [ReadKit](http://readkitapp.com/), [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/), [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/), and [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/)._

Brent Simmons, [on voting](http://inessential.com/2014/11/04/vote): 

> There’s no such thing as remaining neutral or sitting one out. There’s no not-playing-the-game. Not-voting is still playing the game. In a democracy you’re involved no matter what you do.

[Facebook's voting reminder](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/11/04/a-real-time-map-of-everyone-whos-clicked-that-i-voted-button-on-facebook/) &mdash; Roughly 100 million people saw a reminder that it’s Election Day and information about their local polling location. Also, seeing that "I voted" status all over Facebook was a perfect example of positive peer pressure. 

["Why the Nexus 5 has a smaller screen than the iPhone 6"](http://adrianthomas.com/blog/apples-and-nexus) &mdash; It's all about comparing *usable* screen space, not just screen size. 

[Microsoft Office + Dropbox](http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/04/microsoft-teams-up-with-dropbox/) &mdash; Great partnership. I always hated having to download-edit-upload my Office documents, just to make small edits. 

[New Amazon Prime perk: unlimited space for your photos](http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/4/7154107/amazon-prime-customers-now-get-unlimited-cloud-storage-for-photos) &mdash; Sounds neat, but I really just use Amazon Prime for free two-day shipping. 

[Riffsy, the company behind an iOS GIF keyboard, raises $3.5 Million](http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/04/riffsy-3-5m-redpoint/) &mdash; There really are no rules to tech investing are there? 

[Meanwhile, Intel invests in 13-year-old Shubham Banerjee's low-cost Braille printer business](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/04/us-tech-kidentrepreneur-idUSKBN0IO1TA20141104) &mdash; _Technically_ in the same "communications" category as Riffsy, but not really at all. Awesome stuff, from the young Mr. Banerjee. 

[Day #1 of Google's FORM design conference](http://www.google.com/design/form/) &mdash; Matias Duarte, Google's Vice President of design: "We're no longer controlling every pixel. It's going to be more like jazz improvisation." I like where they're heading with this. 

[The 2014 Tools and Toys Christmas Catalog](http://toolsandtoys.net/guides/the-2014-christmas-catalog/) &mdash; Some great stuff on here for your favorite nerd. Personally, I can't recommend the [AeroPress](http://toolsandtoys.net/guides/the-2014-christmas-catalog/#coffee) enough. 

[Motor Trend tests the 2015 Tesla Model S p85D](http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/alternative/1411_2015_tesla_model_s_p85d_first_test/) &mdash; Fast is an understatement. "Insane" is apt. 

[Num for iOS](http://numapp.co/) &mdash; Cute and devilishly difficult math game. Reminds me a bit of [24 Game's](https://www.24game.com/) game mechanics. Free on the App Store. 

[Tinitell, a wristphone for kids](http://tinitell.com/) &mdash; I'm not sure about the "wearables" category just yet, but this type of device is brilliant; particularly for young children. Tinitell was funded on Kickstarter back on May 29, but [recent updates](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/960748838/tinitell-introducing-a-wristphone-for-kids) don't mention much in terms of near-term production. 

[Time to go digital](http://recode.net/2014/11/04/time-inc-races-to-go-digital-before-its-print-business-disappears/) &mdash; _Time_ is pushing digital, as its print business quickly disappears. Perhaps they should tell CNET? 

[Emoji racial diversity](http://www.macrumors.com/2014/11/04/emoji-diversity-skin-tone-modifier/) &mdash; Neat, although it's something I've never really thought of before. Kind of reminds me of [this clip](http://www.youtube.com/embed/WuJBjX89zk4) from _The Office_.

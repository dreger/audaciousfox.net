For a while now, I have wanted to stop writing at [kyledreger.com](http://kyledreger.com). 

Why? For most readers, they've come to my site, read my words, and (probably) closed the tab happy. But for me, there was a growing issue. 

It's awkward as hell to promote an eponymous website. 

This website is something that I want to turn into a real thing. I love writing, and I think I do it pretty well. I'm not a seasoned journalist or essayist, but with practice, I believe I could be, and I know that it won't happen for me if everything I create online falls under the banner of my own name.

And saying things like, "oh, you should go read kyle dreger dot com, I write things like the liberal arts and tech," was beginning to feel...just awkward. 

I don't mind my name in the byline, I quite like it there. However, I want this brand to grow beyond Kyle Dreger. I want to be the only author of my site, and I want to write until the day I die, but, I don't want the site to _be_ me.

They say that the [two hardest things in Computer Science](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html) are cache invalidation and naming things. The latter I know to be true. Picking a name for this site was incredibly difficult; I have a history of terrible name picking. And, with something like this, I wanted to find the perfect fit. 

I wanted it to be something different. Something bold. Something adventurous. Something _audacious_. And why a fox? Because foxes are clever, and the juxtaposition of "fox" and "audacious" just looks cool. 

Because this meta-blogging may seem dull, let's close out with a few final points: 

1. This is the web column I want to read. It will feature articles and musings at the intersection of art and technology. 
2. I want this site to be profitable, which won't take too much. However, goals are good, and I want to make enough to support the site's costs for a year _within_ a year. I'll do this in a way that I'll tell you about later.
3. I love reader feedback, and I strongly encourage you to send me any of your thoughts (or counter arguments) with the [email on this page](/about). 

Simple and audacious. Thanks for reading.

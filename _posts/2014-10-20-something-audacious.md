For the longest time, I've wanted to break away from my site at kyledreger.com. This isn't because I don't like the site, I very much do. However, over time, I have felt that in order to grow the brand, I needed to break away from it being tied to my name. Now, there isn't anything wrog with using an eponomous named blog or website, certainly others have done so. But, for me, I feel akward whever I try to market the site, under my name. "Oh, you should go subscribe to kyledreger.com" **just doesn't** feel classy to me.

So I wanted to do something different. Something bold. Something that I would admit is adventurous. Something _audacious_. And why a fox? Because foxes are clever. Plus, the two together just sound cool.

Now, meta-blogging is incredibly dull, so I'm not going to do that. However, I do want to lay out the expectations I have for this web column:

1. It will feature things that interest me, mostly at the intersection of art and technology.
2. I have a deep interest in the growing field of electric vehicles.
3. There will be memberships available, which you can use to support my writing.

Simple enough for me.

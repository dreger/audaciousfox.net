For a while now, I have wanted to stop writing at [kyledreger.com](http://kyledreger.com). 

It's not that I don't like writing anymore, I do; rather, the actual reason is quite simple: it's awkward as hell to promote an eponymous website. 

I love writing, and I think I do it pretty well. I'm not a seasoned journalist or essayist, but with practice, I believe I could be. However, for me, I foresaw many mental roadblocks, if everything I write falls under the brand of my own name; I want room to grow this site beyond that of "Kyle Dreger." 

They say that the [two hardest things in Computer Science](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html) are cache invalidation and naming things. The latter I know to be true. Picking a name for this site was incredibly difficult, and I have a history of picking terrible names. 

I wanted a bold word. An adventurous word. An _audacious_ word. And why a fox? Because foxes are clever, and the juxtaposition of "fox" and "audacious" just looks cool. 

A few final points: 

1. This is the web column I want to read. It will feature articles and musings at the intersection of art and technology. 
2. I want this site to be profitable, which won't take too much. However, goals are good, and I want this site to be in the black, _within_ a year. 
3. I love reader feedback, and I strongly encourage you to send me any of your thoughts (or counter arguments) with the [email on this page](/about). 

As always, thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy this new space. I sure do.

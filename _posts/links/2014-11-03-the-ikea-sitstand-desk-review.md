[The IKEA Sit/Stand desk review](http://gizmodo.com/ikea-sit-stand-desk-review-i-cant-believe-how-much-i-l-1652445999) &mdash; 
 I use a standing desk at work and absolutely love it. Once we save up some money, I'd consider getting a standing desk for our home office, but I'm not sure whether I'd pick up Shawn Blanc's recommend [Jarvis](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HRFEIF4/ref=nosim&tag=toolsandtoys-20), or this IKEA one.

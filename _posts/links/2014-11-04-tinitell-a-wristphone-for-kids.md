[Tinitell, a wristphone for kids](http://tinitell.com/) &mdash; 
 I'm not sure about the "wearables" category just yet, but this type of device is brilliant; particularly for young children. Tinitell was funded on Kickstarter back on May 29, but [recent updates](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/960748838/tinitell-introducing-a-wristphone-for-kids) don't mention much in terms of near-term production.

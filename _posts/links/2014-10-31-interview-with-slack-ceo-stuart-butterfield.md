[Interview with Slack CEO Stuart Butterfield](http://fortune.com/2014/10/31/stewart-butterfield-slack-billion/) &mdash; 
 Mr. Butterfield: "I think it’s hard in the moment to know exactly why it’s [Slack's] working. Just like Google vs. Alta Vista. At the moment it was difficult to explain, but it’s relatively easy to put your finger on it retroactively." Smart company, run by a smart guy.

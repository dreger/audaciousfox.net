[A happy font family](http://www.frerejones.com/about/press/2014-10-30/) &mdash; 
 Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones have resolved their legal dispute, which started [back in January](http://kyledreger.com/archives/14017-frere-jones-sues-hoefler.html). Hoefler will continue to lead H&Co., and Frere-Jones looks to "return to design work and to launch my own type design practice in the new year."

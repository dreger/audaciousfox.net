[FingerKey: use Touch ID to unlock your Mac](http://www.cultofmac.com/304657/app-lets-unlock-mac-touch-id/) &mdash; 
 Neat, but I don't see this being very useful. Reminds me a bit of [Knock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyX8FfSKg04), which did some similar iPhone-unlocks-your-Mac trickery. These are fun apps to show off to friends but ultimately a bit pointless.

Meet Candace Hill, the 16 year-old girl who can [run much faster than you](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/09/sport/candace-hill-interview/). CNN's Will Edmonds:   

> Hill's official time of 10.98 seconds [in the 100 meter dash] would have been good enough to finish seventh at the 2012 Olympic Games in London, and would have tied for silver at the 2008 Beijing Games four years earlier.

Sweet Nike, that's fast.

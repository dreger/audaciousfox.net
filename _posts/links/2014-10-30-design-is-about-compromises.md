[Design is about compromises](http://toolsandtoys.net/keys-to-go/) &mdash; 
 Logitech has a new super-slim wireless keyboard. I like the colors and the marketed durability, but I'm skeptical about actually typing on keys that thin. Will there be any tactile feedback, or are you better off just using the on-screen keyboard?

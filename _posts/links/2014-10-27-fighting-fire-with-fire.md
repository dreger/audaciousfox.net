[Fighting fire with fire](http://www.anandtech.com/show/8647/amazon-announces-the-fire-tv-stick) &mdash; 
 Amazon: Introducing the Fire TV Stick. Prime Subscribers can [get it for $19](http://amzn.com/B00GDQ0RMG) (next two days only); otherwise, it will run $39 when it ships on November 19th. If we didn't already stream through the PS4, I'd pick one of these up.

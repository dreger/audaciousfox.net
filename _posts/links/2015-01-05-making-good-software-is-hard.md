[Making good software is hard](http://www.panic.com/blog/the-2014-panic-report/) &mdash; 
 Panic Inc. makes some of my go-to apps, including Transmit and Prompt. They've written up the annual Panic Report, and they've written a tad more about their business than usual. It's a good piece, if you've ever wondered what a successful software shop goes through in a year.

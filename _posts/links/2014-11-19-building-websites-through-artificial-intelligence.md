[Building websites through Artificial Intelligence](https://thegrid.io) &mdash; 
 The Grid is a website that builds itself, based on the media outlets you give it. I'm not sold on this idea. The sterile nature of the personality is off-putting for two groups: the techies who could roll their own website, and the artists who want more creative license.

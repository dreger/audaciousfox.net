[&quot;Free&quot; is now &quot;Get&quot;](http://toucharcade.com/2014/11/19/apple-changes-free-to-get-on-app-store-download-buttons/) &mdash; 
 Download buttons for free apps on the App Store now show "Get," instead of "Free." This might just be an experiment, but for free-with-in-app-purchase apps, I think "Get" is a more honest connotation of what the app could _actually_ cost you.

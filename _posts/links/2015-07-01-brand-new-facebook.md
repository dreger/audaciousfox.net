Armin Vit, [writing about](http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_for_facebook_done_in-house_with_eric_olson.php) the new Facebook wordmark: 

> The double-story “a” has been changed to a single-story. The “o”s and “e” are rounder, and the “b” has a more traditional stem. In essence, this is a perfectly acceptable wordmark, a kind of twenty-first-century Franklin Gothic for the millennial generation. It has a great rhythm, it’s perfectly crafted — although the left part of the “e” seems a tad heavy — and it’s very nicely kerned. The problem is that, for lack of a better thought, it does not compute.

[Apple releases WatchKit](https://developer.apple.com/watchkit/) &mdash; 
 Apple has released WatchKit, the framework that will help power Apple Watch. Inside the WatchKit documentation, developers have found previous-unknown specifics about the Apple Watch. Two notable specifics: there are two separate screen resolutions for the different sizes, and Apple has released "San Fransisco;" a custom-made typeface for the smaller UI.

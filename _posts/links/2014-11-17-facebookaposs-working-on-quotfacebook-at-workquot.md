[Facebook&apos;s working on &quot;Facebook at Work&quot;](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/17/us-facebook-website-idUSKCN0J108920141117) &mdash; 
 A standalone version of Facebook for your workplace. Could be useful at large organizations, where the internal intranets are usually terrible. For smaller shops though, I'd recommend Slack.

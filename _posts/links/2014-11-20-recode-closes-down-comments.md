[Re/code closes down comments](http://recode.net/2014/11/20/a-note-to-recode-readers/) &mdash; 
 For a majority (and when I say "majority," I'd argue > 90%) of websites out there, internet comments are a stew of vitriolic language and low quality logic. If you really have something to say, 1.) write an email to the author, or 2.) write your own blog post.

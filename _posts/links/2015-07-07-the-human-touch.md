Robot arms are great at welding car doors on the assembly line, but give them something more delicate than steel, and things can get messy. Enter Professor George Whitesides and soft robotics. Gentle yet deliberate, [these robotic grippers](http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/06/17/soft-robotics-octopus-inspired-robot-hands-delicate-enough-to-grasp-a-tomato/) are nothing more than plastic chambers that fill with compressed air, but they could be a big step forward in giving robotic arms a human touch.

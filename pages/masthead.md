## Miscellany  

The Audacious Fox technical style follows that of the _New York Times Manual of Style_ and our own in-house style guide. 

The accent color changes each week. 

You can switch on _night mode_ by clicking on the sun icon to the right of the site header. 

The sidebar message (found in the left sidebar beneath the navigation), can be hovered over for a not-so-secret message. 

Waffles are the best breakfast food ever. Period. 

Colophon: [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). The domain lives on [Hover.com](http://hover.com). 

Typography: system fonts that don't suck.

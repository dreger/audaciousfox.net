## Tools

I use a variety of tools to publish AF. Below are some of my favorites:

- Words
- Sentences
- Paragraphs
- Witty humor
- Appositive phrases
- Commas

Language &amp; heart — that's all you really need. No MacBook or mechanical keyboard will make you a better writer. These are nice things to have, but never fall into the mistake of believing your writing is dependent on them. If you focus too much on the tools, you're bound to blame them eventually.

This site is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the domain is registered through [Hover.com](http://hover.com). They've both been great, and I highly recommend their services. 

The AF editorial style follows that of the _New York Times Manual of Style_, with several modifications from my own [in-house style guide](/projects/style-guide).

Headlines and copy are set in system fonts that don't suck.

Three great words: energy, diction, and honesty.

Have strong opinions, loosely held. 

Waffles for all meals. Period.

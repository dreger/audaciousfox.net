<p>If you and I were friends, these are the links I'd text you.</p>

<p>This is my opportunity to comment on an article, video, or image that I think you should see. On the front page, linked items are set in all caps, and the title will take you to the original source. </p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> On the front page, the AF icon at the bottom of each article serves as the permalink for that piece.</p>

<p>An archive for my featured pieces can <a href="/archive">be found here</a>.</p>
<ul class="archive">
{% for post in site.categories.linked  %}
  <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a><br><small>{{ post.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y"}}</small></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

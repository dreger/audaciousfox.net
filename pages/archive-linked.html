<p>The Audacious Fox Links are short posts that revolve around an article, video, or image that I think you should see. Links typically include a quote from the original content, and I always include a link to any relevant sources.</p>

<p>On the front page, Links are set in all caps to distinguish them from my original pieces.</p>

<p>An archive for just my longer articles can <a href="/archive">be found here</a>.</p>
<ul class="archive">
{% for post in site.categories.briefings  %}
  <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a><br><small>{{ post.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y"}}</small></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

This document serves as the living style guide for [Audacious Fox](/), and I consider it a personalized list of rules that are a superset of those found in the _New York Times Manual of Style_. The goal of this document is to bring a consistent voice to all the writing on this site.

If you run a web column, please feel free to remix or copy the contents here for your own personal use. If you feel so obliged, a link back to this page is appreciated, but not required. This document will continue to evolve over time, so please check back occasionally.

## Ideology

If you do any sort of writing, particularly online, you should be using a style guide. Having some sort of reference for how _you_ write will help you make consistent editorial decisions, and it will help bring a level of polish to your work that many miss out on.

## Style & Tone

Go read "[The Elements of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style)" by Strunk & White. Brevity and clarity are paramount. Try to avoid didactic language. Write with purpose.

## Reference (A-Z)

- apostrophes

> Following a word that ends in an 's,' "The Moss' house."

> Appositive phrases should be chosen based on the context of your audience. Establish the context of a person, place, or thing without making the reader feel stupid. Ex. "K.Q. Dreger, a writer from Ohio, created the AF Manual of Style, a resource he hopes is copied by bloggers everywhere." Don't be a jerk. Always make it clear who and where you're quoting from. Also, quote things _exactly_ as they appear.

> "Be sparing with quotes. Direct quotes should be used when either the speaker or what he said is surprising, or when the words he used are particularly pithy or graphic. Otherwise you can probably paraphrase him more concisely." — [Economist Style Guide][esg]

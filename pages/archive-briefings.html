<h1>Archive / Briefings</h1>
<p>The Audacious Fox Briefings are a daily list of interesting tabs that I still have open at the end of the day. Another way: "Things I've read that you should too." There is also an index <a href="/archive">for just the articles</a>.</p>
<ul class="archive">
{% for post in site.categories.briefings  %}
  <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> <small>{{ post.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y"}}</small></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

Facebook [released a new little app, called Rooms](http://www.rooms.me). It's cute, and it reminds me a lot of interactions you find in Facebook Paper: lots of bouncy animations and a very gesture-driven UI. The way you invite people to your "room" is also quite clever: you send an image of your room's pass, and your friends' copies of Rooms will automatically pick it up. 

My gut reaction is this has potential. A space exists between text messaging and the full-blown Facebook News Feed, and it's the space where you want to share with a specific group of people; mostly just the ones who will get that inside joke. 

My favorite thing about Rooms is that it lets you customize the "Like" button for each room. In my "Football" (soccer) room, I set our like button to be "Have a go," which changes to "GOALLLL," after you press it. Fun.

There was a lot of blood. 

My first shave was far from perfect. I remember being terrified of ending up in a crumpled heap on my bathroom floor, soaked in my own mix of red blood cells and Barbasol. None of that happened, but I still remember the fear from that morning. 

Four years later, shaving is my most consistently followed routine. Shower, get the facial hairs nice and soft, and then wet the bade and begin. My proficiency with the untiensilsx has matured to the point where I can complete the whole process in less than a minute, without a single cut. 

I think that I'm drawn to shaving because of how simple it is to do. All you need is water, some shaving cream (optional, really) and a blade. And once you've got to a level comfortablitiy with the tools and the process, it doesn't matter if you shave with a single blade BIC from a 25-pack at Walgreens or a Mach-5 Gillete Fushion; you can get the job done. 

I listen to a lot of podcasts, and many of them have a number of sponsors per show. Amidst the regulars of this past year, a new one came up: Harry's. Harry's makes shaving stuff, and they price it low. They even own their own barbershop in NYC, where you can get an authentic shave. 

They also purchased a plant in Germany, where they produce their own blades. 

So, with a $5 coupon, I spent $10 at Harry's (shipping included) to get what, for me, would amount to about a month of 2-3 day shaving supplies.

### On electric shaving

In high school, my first "shave" was with an electric razor. I think the device must have intimidated me, because I ended up pulling out more hairs than actually cutting. 

### Packaging and brand

### Blades

The blades are packaged in a small box. Simple.

Inside, you find a small piece of card stock that instructs you on swapping out a used blade, once it becomes dull.

The blade handle is great. It feels worth the $10 admission fee on its own. The polished handle feels smooth, and it has the subtle Harry's "H" in a reflective metallic color.

Included in the box are two replacement blades. If you haven't noticed yet, Harry's pays close attention to not only typography, but also the microcopy on all its products. These things don't give me a better shave, but I feel this attention is indicative of a bigger company ideology. 


### Cream

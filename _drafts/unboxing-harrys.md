There was a lot of blood, relatively speaking. 

My first shave was far from perfect. I remember being terrified of ending up in a crumpled heap on my bathroom floor, soaked in my own mix of red blood cells and Barbasol. Thankfully, I avoided death; however, I ended up with enough nicks and cuts that I still clearly remember the fear from that morning. 

Four years later, things are much easier. My proficiency with the blade has matured to the point where I can complete the whole shaving process in less than a minute, without a single cut to my face.

Throughout my morning routine, I listen to podcasts. Over the past few months, amidst the regular show sponsors of this past year, a new company name kept coming up: [Harry's](http://harrys.com). Harry's makes shaving stuff. They even own their [own barbershop](https://www.harrys.com/cornershop) in NYC, and they also purchased a [factory in Germany](https://www.harrys.com/our-factory), so they can produce their own blades. 

After hearing their sponsor spot for the umpteenth time, I spent exactly $15 (shipping included) to get what, for me, would amount to about a month of shaving supplies.

_A quick aside, on electric shaving: In high school, my first "shave" was with an electric razor. I think the device must have intimidated me, because I ended up pulling out more hairs than I actually cut. I still own and occasionally use an electric shaver, but only if it's absolutely necessary._ 

### Packaging and brand

When you first open a box from Harry's, the first things that strikes you is that this thing has character. From the small mammoth insignia, to the 

$15 worth of Harry's gear. It doesn't look like a lot, but compared to what that same amount will get you at your local CVS or Walgreens, this was a bargain.

Although the cardboard box looked cheap, it was surprisingly sturdy. 

### Blades

The blades are packaged in a small box. Simple.

Inside, you find a small piece of card stock that instructs you on swapping out a used blade, once it becomes dull.

The blade handle is great. It feels worth the $10 admission fee on its own. The polished handle feels smooth, and it has the subtle Harry's "H" in a reflective metallic color.

Included in the box are two replacement blades. If you haven't noticed yet, Harry's pays close attention to not only typography, but also the microcopy on all its products. These things don't give me a better shave, but I feel this attention is indicative of a bigger company ideology. 


### Cream

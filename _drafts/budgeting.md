title: Married and Budgeting

My junior year of college, I had no earthly idea how to manage my money. 

I was working part-time at some of the offices on campus, and I made a little money working as a writing center tutor, but by the time the next paycheck would roll around, I would be broke. 

Sadly, this was something that had plagued me most of my life. Since I lived and worked in an industry where the "latest" app can be bought for mere pennies, I don't think I ever felt the sting of poor money management like I should have.

One of the first things my then-fiancee and I talked about was our perspective on money. 

My wife and I share our money. It's a collective "our" income and "our" debts. This, in my opinion, is the right way to go about sharing finances. 

However, once you leave college, there are real things that you need, and those real things are going to cost real money, and that real money will run out real quick, if you treat it like you have up until this point. 

Enter budgeting. 

Initially, budgeting may sound like a nerdy, oh-so-you-majored-in-accounting word, but it's not. What I've found budgeting to be is _freeing_. I spend money on things I like, and I never worry about having enough to pay our bills each month. Part of this is the blessing of a having a job, but even if I were to lose my job tomorrow, my wife and I wouldn't have to change a single part of our lifestyle. 

## What budgeting is

So what is budgeting? At its core, budgeting is setting aside money from each paycheck to go towards a specific goal or bill. That's it. You get paid, you give each of those dollars a job, and then you only spend whatever you've set aside for a particular activity. Here are some real activities ("categories") that my wife and I have set up for our budget: 

- Eating out
- Groceries
- Car fuel
- Home things

When cash was more prevalent, a great way to do budgeting was to have physical envelopes with the names of each category on them.  Whenever you got paid, you would then take that paycheck and divvy it up between the envelopes. A few days later, if you need milk and cereal, you would go to the "Groceries" envelope, only spending up to whatever was in there. 

But managing cash sucks, especially if your employer offers direct deposit. It's much more convenient to only need your debit card. 

## YNAB

Much of this would not be possible without the people at You Need A Budget. Their app, YNAB, is a stable to our system, and it does a great job at helping get those new to budgeting up and running. 



Let's say, for the sake of even numbers, you make $1,000 a month. The _wrong_ way to budget would be to take that grand of cash, throw it in your checking account, and then pray it doesn't run out until the next paycheck. That's a bad idea. 

A better, less terrible way, is to

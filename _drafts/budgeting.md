title: Married and Budgeting

My wife and I share our money. It's a collective "our" income and "our" debts. This, in my opinion, is the best way to approach money in marriage. Sharing all our money not only keeps you accountable, but also allows us to keep the dialogue of our financial goals open and frequent. It's been a great, albeit learning, experience for the both of us. 

My junior year of college, I had no earthly idea how to manage my money. 

I was working part-time at some of the offices on campus, and I made a little money working as a writing center tutor, but by the time the next paycheck would roll around, I would be broke. 

Sadly, this was something that had plagued me most of my life. Since I lived and worked in an industry where the "latest" app or utility can be bought for mere pennies, I don't think I ever felt the sting of poor money management like I should have. 

Thankfully, things changed. Engaged and going into my senior year, I decided to get serious about saving and managing my money. Fast-forward to today, and my wife and I have a very stable financial footing. We set up end-of-year savings goals, and we're keeping an eye on the areas that we're prone to overspend (spoiler: Starbucks and eating out).

I've had a lot of help throughout this process, and I want to especially thank Dr. Gwen Gray Schwarts, Dr. Rodney Dick, and Christopher Durr for their advice.

Once you leave college, there are going to be real things that you need, and those real things are going to cost real money, and that real money will run out real quick, if you don't pay attention. 

Enter budgeting. 

Initially, budgeting may sound like a nerdy, oh-so-you-majored-in-accounting word, but it's not. I've found budgeting to be _freeing_. I spend money on things I like, and I never worry about having enough to pay our bills each month. Part of this is the blessing of a having a solid job with a good income; however, budgeting has helped create a lifestyle where, if I were to lose 3/4 of my income, my wife and I wouldn't have to change a single thing about our lives. 

That is an incredibly freeing place to be. 

## Budgeting quick intro

So what is budgeting? At its core, budgeting is setting aside money from each paycheck to go towards a specific goal or _category_ of expenses. That's it. You get paid, you give those dollars a job, and then you only spend whatever you have set aside for a particular category. Here are some of the categories that my wife and I have set up for our budget: 

- Eating out
- Groceries
- Car fuel
- Car repairs
- Fun (movies, clothing, apps)
- Cell phones
- Internet
- Summer vacation 2015

Notice the mixture of month-to-month (eating out, groceries, fun) and long-term (summer vacation, car repairs) expenses. Also think about how bills (cell phones, internet) will be relatively consistent from month-to-month.

## The Real Costs

Before I graduated, the biggest question I had about budgeting was _what_ am I going to be paying for? Some of these may not apply to you, but we'll reference this for the rest of the article:  

### Fixed costs
- Car fuel
- Car lease
- Car insurance
- Electric
- Gas
- Groceries
- Internet
- Phone
- Rent
- Rent insurance 
- Student loan
- Subscriptions
- Tithing

### Discretionary costs
- Charity
- Eating out
- Fun
- House
- Medical
- School + Work

### Rainy day
- Car repair 
- Buffer*
- Gifts
- Vacation
- Nest Egg&trade;**

To keep things simple, we put all of our expenses into one of three "master" categories: 

- **Fixed costs** &mdash; Things that you have to pay for every month, like a cell phone bill or groceries. This is also the master category for things that we _will_ have to pay for in a lump sum amount, like a six-month car insurance premium. If we know that in six months we need to pay $600, we'll set aside $100 every month for this purpose, and when it's time to pay, we just pay it. 
- **Discretionary costs** &mdash; General things that we pay for each month but that we're not obliged to pay for. This master category accounts for things like going to the movies, that new hoodie, or going out to eat. This master category is flexible, because you can reduce the spending here, without missing a payment. 
- **Rainy day** &mdash; Long-term expenses and things that you want to save for. An example: Christmas gifts are expensive, and we may not care about saving for them during the spring and summer. However, by tossing $10 into the Gifts category every month, you'll have $120 to spend, come December!
- **Buffer** &mdash; The Buffer is just that: a special slush-fund to put any "extra" funds in, after you're done allocating money.  Think of it as a liquid-able savings account. The Buffer is nice, because it allows us to have a little wiggle room, if we ever go over in a particular category. For us, we're trying to get our Buffer to the point where we have a month's worth of funds inside. 
- **The Nest Egg&trade;** &mdash; The Nest Egg is in the Rainy Day master category for simplicity, but it's really just a placeholder for our long-term savings account. There is only one rule with the Nest Egg: you never, ever, touch the money inside. It's the first category that we put money into, and it will be the last one we take money out of. It just sits there and grows. We're trying to put a solid 15-20% of our income each month to the Nest Egg, and it's already surprised me at how large it has grown after just six months.

## The cash conundrum 

When cash was more prevalent, a great way to do budgeting was to have physical envelopes with the names of each category on them.  Whenever you got paid, you would then take that paycheck and divvy it up between the envelopes. A few days later, if you need milk and cereal, you would go to the "Groceries" envelope, only spending up to whatever was in there. 

But managing cash sucks, especially if your employer offers direct deposit. It's much more convenient to only need your debit card. 

## YNAB

Much of this would not be possible without the people at You Need A Budget. Their app, YNAB, is a stable to our system, and it does a great job at helping get those new to budgeting up and running. 



Let's say, for the sake of even numbers, you make $1,000 a month. The _wrong_ way to budget would be to take that grand of cash, throw it in your checking account, and then pray it doesn't run out until the next paycheck. That's a bad idea. 

A better, less terrible way, is to

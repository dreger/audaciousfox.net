I'm glad that most of the websites I visit today are responsive. It makes browsing the web from my phone more enjoyable, and, from a technical standpoint, it oft means only maintaining one codebase, which is great. 

But web typography still sucks. You'll see sites that manage to pull off the "responsive" part of Responsive Web Design but that forget about their text. Titles with line-height far too large, or paragraph text that simply fills the mobile screen, without consideration given to the line-height, size, or weight is far too often seen.

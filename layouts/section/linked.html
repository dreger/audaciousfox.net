<h1>Archive / Linked To</h1>
<p>If you and I were friends, these are the links Iâ€™d text you.</p>

<p>This is my opportunity to comment on an article, video, or image that I think you should see. On the front page, linked items are set in all caps, and the title will take you to the original source. </p>

<p>An archive for my featured pieces can <a href="/archive">be found here</a>.</p>
<ul class="archive">
  {{ range .Data.Pages }}

      <br><small>{{ .Date.Format "2 January 2006" }}</small></li>

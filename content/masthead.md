## Style, Both Visual &amp; Written

I aim to write so you don't need to skim. Rigorous editing is a cornerstone of this website, and I keep an [in-house style guide](/projects/style-guide), which you‚Äôre welcome to read and remix. 

This site is hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com), and the domain is registered through [Hover](http://hover.com). They've both been great, and I highly recommend their services. 

Headlines are set in [Concourse](http://practicaltypography.com/concourse.html), with [Charter](http://practicaltypography.com/charter.html) handling the body copy. **AF** should look good in all modern web browsers; please let me know if it doesn't. 

## Your Host, Briefly 

I'm a product designer, working out of Northeast Ohio. **Audacious Fox** is run out of my own pocket and in my spare time. When I'm not writing, I'll usually be playing soccer or reading. 

Random tidbits I wish to impart upon you: Energy, diction, and honesty are three great words; Have strong opinions, loosely held; Waffles are the bar by which all other breakfast foods are judged. 

## Other Writers Worth Reading

I read pretty much everything these folks put out. I update this list every couple of months, so check back from time to time. Have someone that should be on here? Drop me a note.

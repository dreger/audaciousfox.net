## Style, Both Visual &amp; Written

In most cases, the AF editorial style follows that of the _New York Times Manual of Style_, with several modifications from my own [in-house style guide](/projects/style-guide).

This site is hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com), and the domain is registered through [Hover](http://hover.com). They've both been great, and I highly recommend their services. 

Headlines are set in [Concourse](http://practicaltypography.com/concourse.html), with [Charter](http://practicaltypography.com/charter.html) handling the body copy. AF should look good in all modern web browsers; please let me know if it doesn't. 

Three great words: energy, diction, and honesty.

Have strong opinions, loosely held.

Waffles for all meals. Period.

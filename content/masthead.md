This site is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the domain is registered through [Hover.com](http://hover.com). They've both been great, and I highly recommend their services.

The AF editorial style follows that of the _New York Times Manual of Style_, with several modifications from my own [in-house style guide](/projects/style-guide).

Headlines and copy are set in system fonts that don't suck.

Three great words: energy, diction, and honesty.

Have strong opinions, loosely held.

Waffles for all meals. Period.

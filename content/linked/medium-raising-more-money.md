Companies that aren't profitable either die or raise more cash—that's obvious and not why I'm linking to this story. What makes this piece by Jim Edwards, *Business Insider*, interesting are the readership stats and hint towards future product direction for Medium: 

> The site currently has 90 million unique users each month, and publishes 20,000 articles per day, mostly from writers creating one-off articles. It recently moved away from selling advertising as a revenue model to a subscription paywall, in which readers are asked for money if they see more than three stories per month. [...]

> The investment will go into Williams' effort to make Medium a bit more like a vast, thoughtful magazine. What started as a longform blogging platform is looking more and more like The Atlantic crossed with Wikipedia. Williams has a corp of editors who are paying fees or commissions to writers for high-quality material, and then keeping that high-quality content behind the paywall. While the majority of Medium's writers are amateurs writing for coffee money, the professional work — which feels a lot like the journalism you'd see in a monthly magazine — will get much of the investment, he said.

Some additional, unverified (but I trust them) stats [from Twitter user Kontra][kontra]: 

> How far has Medium come? 
> 
> Articles published daily: 20,000  
> Articles in archive: 20 million  
> Monthly unique readers: 90 million  
> Content spend in 2018: $5 million  
> Employees: 100  
> Money raised since 2012: $134 million

If Medium is to truly become a "vast, thoughtful magazine" then I think the days of using Medium as an online home for your identity and writing are stone cold dead. That's fine—at least they're acknowledging that's the direction they want to move in. *Medium* is the brand. 

And that could actually work, by the way. A high-quality, diversely-written, and online magazine sounds compelling. Stripe's excellent [*Increment*](https://increment.com) comes to mind. With enough contributors and content, the law of large numbers suggests Medium could curate a fresh batch of good reads every day. Think that occasionally good Reddit comment, but with actual copy editing. Who knows if people will pay for it, though. 

This all sidesteps the fact that reading anything on Medium is a mess right now. If I'm not being interrupted to sign up for an account, then the ancillary visual garbage taints what might otherwise be an OK reading experience. We'll also ignore the litany of trackers, analytics, and other JavaScript that every page seemingly requires. It's gotten to the point that whenever I see a URL starting with `medium.com`, I experience the same Pavlovian-driven dread as when someone shoots me a link to Quora.

I'm not going to mock an interface that was obviously done by someone who might have a few other important things on their plate, but this is an incredibly misleading design. Thank God you can only send mobile alerts from here and not, you know, actual missiles. 

A practical, real example for why you should start your interface designs by [focusing on the words][words]. 

Aside: Although the correction took too long to get out, I thought the [message on Hawaii's digital highway signs][nyt], "missile alert / in error / there is no threat" was particularly terse and efficient.

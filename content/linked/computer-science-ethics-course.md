Natasha Singer, *New York Times*: 

> The courses are emerging at a moment when big tech companies have been struggling to handle the side effects — [fake news on Facebook](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/technology/facebook-russia-ads-.html), [fake followers on Twitter](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html), lewd [children’s videos](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/media/youtube-kids-paw-patrol.html) on YouTube — of the industry’s build-it-first mind-set. They amount to an open challenge to a common Silicon Valley attitude that has generally dismissed ethics as a hindrance.

> “We need to at least teach people that there’s a dark side to the idea that you should move fast and break things,” said [Laura Norén](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/faculty/LauraNoren.html), a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Data Science at New York University who began teaching a new data science ethics course this semester. “You can patch the software, but you can’t patch a person if you, you know, damage someone’s reputation.”

Nellie Bowles, *New York Times*, reporting on the increasing analogue world influence of esports:

> Across North America this year, companies are turning malls, movie theaters, storefronts and parking garages into neighborhood esports arenas.

> At the same time, content farms are spinning up in Los Angeles, where managers now see gamers as some peculiar new form of famous person to cultivate — half athlete, half influencer.

> And much of it is powered by the obsession with one game: Fortnite. Over the last month, people have spent more than [128 million hours](https://sullygnome.com/game/Fortnite/30/summary) on Twitch just watching other people play Fortnite, the game that took all the best elements of building, shooting and survival games and merged them into one.

I like watching streamers play *Fortnite* just like I enjoy watching Liverpool play on Saturdays. At the end of the day, it's entertainment. However, what I find particularly appealing about esports is that the competitive scene isn't geographically limited in the same way that physical sports are. I think this allows esports players to improve more quickly—and become more entertaining to watch—because they're able to instantly compete against people from all over the world.

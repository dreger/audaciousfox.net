[Brian Feldman](http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/07/how-fortnite-became-the-most-popular-video-game-on-earth.html) for *New York Magazine*: 

> Analysts estimate that *Fortnite* is currently raking in more than $300 million a month, and has made its maker, Epic Games, more than $1.2 billion since its battle royale mode launched in late September. [...]

Over 125 million people play *Fortnite*, but what caught my eye was this bit about one of *Fortnite's* most famous players, Tyler "Ninja" Blevins: 

> Ninja, whose real name is Tyler Blevins, makes an estimated half a million dollars every month streaming *Fortnite* rounds on Twitch, a service for livestreaming video games that is owned by Amazon. 

There's a crazy amount of money in being a top esports streamer right now. 

> Ninja’s role in the *Fortnite* origin story has to do with [the Drake stream](http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/03/what-is-fortnite-and-why-is-drake-playing-it.html). On March 14, around midnight, Ninja streamed the game with Drake, single-handedly legitimizing *Fortnite* as a mainstream juggernaut. The stream also featured special guests rapper Travis Scott, NFL player JuJu Smith-Schuster, and online-piracy mogul Kim Dotcom, and broke the record for most concurrent viewers of a non-tournament stream — 628,000 people. How the stream came about is a perfect illustration of 21st-century celebrity networking: Drake told Ninja that he’d seen highlights of Ninja on Instagram.

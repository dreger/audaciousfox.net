title: "Mario Mandžukić's Stunning Goal in the 2017 Champions League Final"
---

Juventus' Mario Mandžukić had one of the best goals you will ever see in soccer, let alone in a Champions League Final. Two passes, six touches, all in the air, ending with an overhead bicycle. 

Real Madrid may have handily won the match 4–1, but Mandžukić's goal is all anyone's talking about. Stunning.

**Update**: Here's [an unofficial video of the goal][goal] that includes the commentators' reaction.

Agentina's has a lackluster performance in the first two matches of their World Cup group play — first a draw with Iceland, and then an embarrassing loss to Croatia. Tariq Panja, *the New York Times*: 

> Disappointing against Iceland, Argentina put in a shambolic display against Croatia here in a 3-0 loss that left it on the verge of early elimination. Even if Manager Jorge Sampaoli can somehow solve his misfiring team’s numerous deficiencies and defeat Nigeria in its final Group D game, Argentina will still need other results to go its way to qualify for the knockout phase.

Reminder: four years ago, Agentina was in — but lost — the World Cup final. 

> From the start, Sampaoli’s rejiggered defense looked liable to make an error — and exactly that happened, in the 53rd minute when goalkeeper Wilfredo Caballero gifted Croatia’s Ante Rebic the game’s opening goal. At the other end, Messi, usually such a potent attacking force, looked like a man strolling in a park while a soccer match took place around him. In the first hour, Messi played just 15 passes. By the end of the match, Caballero had made more passes than Messi: 36 to 31.

Two things. First, Ante Rebic's opening goal [was sublime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9TbvIwBQl8) — his composure and placement were simply perfect. Second, Mr. Panja's description of Messi as "a man strolling in a park" is devaluing one of Messi's most understated strengths — he walks better than most players run. Bobby Gardiner for *FiveThirtyEight*: 

> Throughout his career, Messi [has been criticized for walking](http://www.espnfc.com/uefa-champions-league/story/1780845/stats-show-how-barcelonas-lionel-messi-failed-to-influence-atletico-madrid-game). After an El Clasico match between Barcelona and Real Madrid in December 2017, there was [widespread coverage](https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/how-barcas-lionel-messi-decided-the-clasico-in-walking-mode-6517548) of the fact that Messi walked 83 percent of the roughly 5 miles he covered that game. Despite this, he scored and assisted in Barca's 3-0 trouncing. [...]

> We've known this trait of Messi's for quite some time: [In 2014 World Cup coverage](http://www.slate.com/articles/sports/sports_nut/2014/07/lionel_messi_2014_world_cup_the_world_s_best_player_has_figured_out_how.html?via=gdpr-consent), Ken Early remarked that "only Messi has figured out how to win matches by moving less than everyone else." 

At this point, Argentina's destiny is not their own, and it's possible they don't make it through to the knock-out stage. Messi's walkabout style may work better when he's backed by Barcelona's squad, but even if his country is eliminated during the group stage, Messi's soccer I.Q.

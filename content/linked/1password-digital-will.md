*The Sweet Setup Staff* (via [Michael Rockwell][mw]), on using the password manager [1Password][1p] as a digital will: 

> A digital will is a new concept that we are just feeling the effects of in recent years. Unlike a conventional will, **this document (or database) is not as much about who gets your stuff, but more about helping your family member unwind the countless online accounts and collections of media and digital property that you have.**

When my mother passed away a number of years ago, one of the ways we were caught unprepared was in dealing with all of the online bills, email accounts, and digital subscriptions for my family. If I hadn't been making copies of those credentials into my personal 1Password database, it would have been a nightmare within a nightmare to untangle. I truly don't know what we would have done — call the Gmail team? 

Back to the linked-to piece: the team at the *Sweet Setup* have done an excellent job writing up the 1Password-as-a-will angle, but they've also just [launched an entirely new 1Password course][1p tss] that goes deep on the many other ways 1Password can bring security and sanity to your digital life. There's a launch price special for $23 (cheap!), and any course purchase gets you an extended 90-day free trial of 1Password itself. Excellent deal. 

I try not to write in absolutes, but 1Password is the kind of app that I'd happily pay for until the day I die. I really don't know how else to put it.

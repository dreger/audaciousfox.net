Just over 400 days ago, I started writing code to build an iOS app I had always wanted: a simple, one page text editor. Although originally codenamed Stet, a year of writing code, deleting code, beta testing with friends, and annoying family members would eventually led to what I'm releasing today: Edit for iOS. 

Edit has several neat features (dark mode, pinch-to-zoom text size, word and character count), but I think the most interesting one is that Edit doesn't store multiple notes. You get one page, and whatever you leave there will be there when you come back. Because of this, I've found that Edit *complements* many of the other great writing and note taking apps out there instead of competing with them. You can start something in Edit, punch it up, check the character or word count, and then export it to anywhere in iOS. I've used Edit to create grocery lists, draft journal entries, and as a place to reference important information I needed that day. 

Edit is [available as a pre-order on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1231744746) for $1.99, and I'll be releasing it soon. It also comes with a 10-year good faith guarantee, which basically means it should continue to work and be available for your next decade of iOS devices. Neat, no?

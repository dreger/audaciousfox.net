Short and sweet: 

* You use this website and everything hosted here at your own risk. Anything you download to your computer is also done so at your own risk. 
* All linked to websites are thoroughly vetted; however, if you visit anything not hosted at audaciousfox.net, the liability changes to adhere to those listed in the privacy policy and terms of that website. 

## Ads

I do not run any third-party advertisements.  

## Analytics

As of May 2018, I do not use any analytics or aggregation services to interpret information sent by your browser as a way of discerning things like referrals, page views, or visitor device information. 

## Cloud.Typography

*Audacious Fox* uses a webfont provided by Hoefler & Co. through a service called Cloud.typography. However, this service does not use cookies or JavaScript to serve the font files, and the only information collected by the Cloud.typography service is used to manage my billing with Hoefler & Co. For more information, you can read the terse [Cloud.typography declaration][hco], which enumerates what data they collect and why.

## Communications 

Unless I ask you for permission, anything you email me will be kept anonymous. 

Speaking of, please [email me](/masthead) if you have any questions.

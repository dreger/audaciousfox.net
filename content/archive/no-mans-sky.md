title: No Man's Sky
---


In 1969, the world followed Apollo 11 as it ascended into our atmosphere and transcended our perceived notions of American achievement.

Despite the eventual success of that mission, President Nixon was not aloof to the potential for tragedy.  In a speech titled, “In the Event of a Moon Disaster,” Nixon's speechwriter Bill Safire penned the following lines:

> In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.

> Others will follow and surely find their way home. Man's search will not be denied. But these men were the first, and they will remain the foremost in our hearts.

> For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind.

Which brings me to Hello Games' most recent video game, No Man’s Sky.

There are no boxes into which one can put No Man’s Sky (NMS). A mixture of survival and adventure, NMS is fun and frustrating in ways that I’ve never really experienced before.

One of NMS's most hyped features, the procedural generation of the game world, works as advertised, and you are able to travel from planet surface to space and back without any loading screens. It's not just open world, it's open universe, and I'd love to see other games take advantage of this type of technology.

Yet, the luster of procedurally-generated worlds quickly wears off after a few hours. As you explore planet after planet, you realize that the gameplay becomes incredibly repetitive and mundane. There are a quintillion miles of worlds to explore, but the experience on each is only an inch deep.

In short: You will marvel at parts of NMS, but you will enjoy them much less at its current $60 price.  

## Opening Shot

When you launch the game, you're greeted with `NO MAN’S SKY` in black against a white background. What I love most about this title is the capital `S` letterform, where the bottom tail of the spine is shorter than the top. Typically, when creating a typeface, the designer will attempt to instill a sense of symmetry, of balance. But this `S`, should it be rendered into a physical form, would most surly topple over.

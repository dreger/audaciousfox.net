What a week. If you haven't been keeping up Liverpool lately, they're killing it. I haven't seen them lose yet and that's something.

## [Susan J. Fowler's year in review](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2019/12/10/my-year-in-review-2019)

> 2019 was a really big year for me. It was also a really difficult year, but I think the challenges I faced gave me more clarity and determination than I would’ve otherwise had.

I look up to her so much.

> WT:Social’s interface is rather sparse at the moment, featuring a simple feed comprised of news stories and comments below them. News is a big part of the network; it’s a spinoff of Wales’ previous project, WikiTribune, which sought to be a global news site comprised of professional journalists and citizen contributors. Both WikiTribune and WT:Social emphasize combatting fake news, highlighting evidence-based coverage over the focus on ‘engagement’ seen on other networks. Each story posted to the network makes prominent where the article comes from, as well as sources and references.

I think Facebook can change their image to benign faster thatn WT:Social can gain any sort of market share.

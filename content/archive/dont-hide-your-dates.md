Why do bloggers—or their designers—decide to hide *when* something was written? I usually see this happen when dates are (a) omitted from the URL or (b) hidden/seriously de-emphasized on the page itself.

For URLs, I think dates are useful. Without tapping on a link, I can instantly get a sense of when it was written and (usually) the title. That's a good user experience in my book. 

But I understand not wanting any extra cruft in your URLs. Having a clean domain.com/post-title structure is attractive to my inner minimalist. And for sites like Medium, I'd argue having the year in there is way better than the horrid /post-title-GIB3R1S# article ID at the end. 

As for hiding the date on the page itself, I understand that less. Whether your content is timely or timeless, the words are bound by time. Dates give timely pieces a sense of place, and timeless pieces get credibility or context as to why they're not, well, timeless.

As a reader, when something was written is important context. So don't hide your dates.

# Edit for iOS

Write here, send anywhere. 

- One sheet (no document management)
- Day and night mode
- Quickly select all text to start fresh
- Export anywhere
- Pinch-to-zoom font size
- Word and character count

<!-- 

NO FILESYSTEM OR SETTINGS

No Filesystem? Think of Edit as a single sheet of paper. Whatever you leave in the app will instantly be there when you come back. If you want to send or save text elsewhere—like to Notes or iMessage—just tap the share icon. Edit complements your existing tools.

No Settings? Edit only has one screen, and it’s 100% dedicated to your words.
 

## A FEW THINGS YOU’LL LIKE

Day + Night Mode
My newborn keeps me up at night, Edit tries not to.

Select All
Quickly select everything with a single tap. Great for starting fresh. 

Share Anywhere
Send or save your text anywhere using iOS's built-in share sheet. 

Pinch-to-Zoom Text
Quickly make text larger or smaller with a familiar gesture. 

Word + Character Count
Nice for goals or tweets. 

Zero Lag
I loaded “War and Peace” into Edit, and it didn’t even blink.

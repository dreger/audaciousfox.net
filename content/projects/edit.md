# Edit for iOS

[Edit][edit] is a super fast scratchpad for your thoughts. Think of it as a single sheet of paper, not a notebook. There's no document storage, because whatever you leave in Edit will be there when you get back. Once you're done writing, you can send or save your text to anywhere in iOS via the Share Sheet. 

### What's in the box? 

* One sheet: come right back to what you're working on.
* Night mode: for when you want to write at night. 
* One-touch select all: so you can quickly clear the page. 
* Export: send your text to anywhere in iOS. 
* Word/character count: know how much you've written. 
* Pinch-to-zoom font size: just like with photos, but for text.  

### It'll outlive your iPhone

I've intentionally kept Edit simple so it stays fast and easy to maintain. The other benefit of this simplicity is that Edit should continue to run without issue on iOS devices for years to come. Because of that, I'm slapping a 10-year good faith guarantee on Edit's general availability. Should there come a time over the next decade where I'm unable to update Edit to run on the latest version of iOS, I'll open source the code for anyone to download and run themselves.

Happy writing,

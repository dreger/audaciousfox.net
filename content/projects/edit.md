# Edit for iOS

*See the [announcement post][af] or go directly to the [App Store listing][edit].*

[Edit][edit] is a tasteful place to write. Think of it as a single page of paper, not a notebook. You get a single note, and whatever you leave in the app will be there when you get back. Once you're done writing, you can send or save your text to anywhere in iOS via the Share Sheet. 

### What's in the box? 

* One sheet: return instantly to what you were writing.
* Dark mode: for when you want to write at night. 
* One-touch select all: effortlessly clear the page.
* Export: send your text to anywhere in iOS. 
* Word/character count: know how much you've written. 
* Pinch-to-zoom font size: just like with photos, but for text.  

### It'll outlive your iPhone

I've intentionally kept Edit simple so it stays fast and easy to maintain. The other benefit of this simplicity is that Edit should continue to run without issue on iOS devices for years to come. Because of that, I'm slapping a 10-year good faith guarantee on Edit's general availability. Should there come a time over the next decade where I'm unable to update Edit to run on the latest version of iOS, I'll open source the code for anyone to download and run themselves.

Happy writing,

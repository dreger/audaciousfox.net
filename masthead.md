The accent color changes each week. 

You can switch on _night mode_ by clicking on the sun icon to the right of the site header. 

The sidebar message (found in the left sidebar beneath the navigation), can be hovered over for a not-so-secret message. 

Waffles are the best breakfast food ever. Period.

## Previous sidebar messages

Here is the collection of messages we post in the sidebar. 

- 2015-07-20: I can't stop playing Rocket League, and I feel that I'm only getting worse. 
- 2015-07-13: A jack of all trades is a master of none, but stick around and we'll help you become one. 
- 2015-07-6: Waffles are, quite simply, the most perfect breakfast food. (No seriously, waffles are amazing. Christopher and I actually have a literal 'award winning' waffle recipe. Granted, the award was won during our local church cook off, but hey - award winning nonetheless.)
